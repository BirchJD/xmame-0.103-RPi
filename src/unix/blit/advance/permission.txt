Yes, sure you can use it.
Just give me a credit, that's all.

AdvanceMAME uses a rewritten implementation of the effects. It's GPL, but
 it's allowed to link with MAME, so also with xmame.

I used this address: maxim@hiend3d.com, anyway his code is downloadable on
 his site and it's LGPL.

All the code is in the advance/blit directory. The hq*.* files are for the
 HQ2/3/4x effects, the lq*.* files are for the LQ2/3/4x effects and the
 scale*.* files are for the Scale2/3/4x effects. For any effect is defined a
 function that apply the effect on a single scanline. These functions are
 used in the advance/blit/blit.c file.

Be warned that the advance/blit/interp.h file in the current AdvanceMAME
 contains a precision error. You must get it from CVS or wait the upcoming
 AdvanceMAME 0.75.0.
