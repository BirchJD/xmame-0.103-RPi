Reported in 0.74.1
- Look into adding new AdvanceMAME effects and TV and arcade monitor support.

Reported in 0.61.1
- Make the blit core obey the updatebounds rectangle that's passed to 
  osd_update_video_and_audio().
- Add dirty pixels support to the vector code.
- In devices.c, fill in the bodies of osd_analogjoy_read(), 
  osd_is_joystick_axis_code(), and osd_lightgun_read().
- Update the docs/FAQs for OpenGL to mention http://dri.sourceforge.net and 
  using glxgears to test for 3D acceleration.
- Change the debugger support so that both the debug and game window can be 
  open at the same time.
- Add the pthreads code from Andrea Mazzoleni.  Make sure this works with more 
  than just Linux or that it can be selectively enabled/disabled.
- Add xinerama support, so that xmame can send its output to a particular 
  display, as mplayer does with its -xineramascreen switch.
- Add XVidMode support, so non-root users can change the resolution.

Reported in 0.60.1:
- Add support for external configuration files for special controllers, as in 
  the Windows version.

Reported in 0.57.1:
- Figure out why hotdogst compiled with gcc 2.95.x is crashing when the bomb 
  button is hit.

Reported in 0.56.1:
- Look into adding VESA/FB support, as per MPlayer.

Reported in 0.55.1:
- Fix the tiny build for cvs mess.
- Williams games look messed up when using xmame.xgl -fullscreen.
- Add a note to the docs about Red Hat's nasm package screwing up builds.  Try
  to detect this case.

Reported in 0.54.1:
- See if nec765_dummy.c is necessary anymore in xmess.
- Figure out a way to force the use of DGA 1.0 on startup.
- Put back the -mono flag that existed around xmame-0.34.x.

Reported in 0.53.1:
- 8bpp mode is no longer supported by the core.  There may be a way for xmame 
  to downgrade the 16bpp bitmap so that we can support 8bpp video modes, at 
  least for games which use 256 or fewer colors.  For those which use more, we
  might be able to use a 332 RGB mode.
- One of the files uses a variable called "x11" which causes a compile error.
  Chris Stone thinks it's probably a macro in an X11 include file that's
  interfering.  If there isn't a straightforward way to fix it in xmame, I'll
  see if the core folks would be so kind as to rename the variable.
- Running xmame --version still tries to read the various .xmamerc files.  
  "Fix" this if it's simple to do.
- Change the joystick code so that if a numeral if something like -jdev
  /dev/input/js1 is specified, then that literal string is tried before
  appending 0, 1, 2, etc. to the device name.
- Running xmame.xgl with ssf2tu, sfa3, and spf2xj won't work if something
  changes the default.cfg (e.g., editing the controls).  They will work again
  after deleting default.cfg.

Reported in 0.37b16.1:
- xmame.sdl doesn't work under BeOS; it just stalls.
- xmame.xgl will crash if you pause/unpause when running sfz3jr1 with
  -fullscreen and -bpp 16.  This could be specific to running the NVidia 
  drivers with a GeForce 2 MX 64Mb card; I can't reproduce it with my Matrox 
  G400.
- xmame.xgl will crash if you try to run it with a "NO GOOD DUMP KNOWN" rom.
  After crashing like this, subsequent attempts to run cps1/cps2 games will 
  also crash it until X is restarted.  This might be a problem with NVidia's 
  XFree86 binary.
- A couple people have reported that asterix and gradius3 run fine once and 
  then never runs again, reporting that a couple of the ROMs are bad.  I 
  haven't been able to reproduce this.  I wonder if it might have something to
  do with a bad .cfg file being written out.  One user (garph) reports it 
  happening on NetBSD 1.5 in plain X11 mode, so there's no exotic setup in 
  common.  Update: Using -fakesound appears to make the problem go away.
- Hot Chase (hotchase) endlessly cycles through its initialization screens. 
  This doesn't happen with mamew.  The solution is to use the asm 68k core 
  instead of the C one.
- Update the docs to mention the problems using the nasm that comes bundled 
  with Red Hat.  Encourage people to use a vanilla nasm 0.98 or higher.

Reported in 0.37b15.1:
- Certain games, such as kabuki, hang when running xmame.xgl, unless you first
  run another version of xmame (e.g., xmame.x11) and get past the legal screen.
  It looks like its the absence of a .cfg file that prevents xmame.xgl from
  running the game.  Thus far I have no idea why, though.
- Switching to fullscreen DGA mode and then quitting xmame screws up the
  keyboard.  Apparently this has something to do with xmame losing the ctrl or
  alt release codes; pressing ctrl or alt a few times should restore the
  keyboard to a sane state.
- Figure out how to handle mess_printf.  This may only exist in mess cvs right
  now.

Reported in 0.37b14.1:
- Add -steadykey support from MAME.
