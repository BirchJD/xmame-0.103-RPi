Release 0.103, 16 January 2006
	- Everything from MAME 0.103 (http://x.mame.net/changes-mame.html) and
	  MESS 0.103 (http://x.mame.net/changes-mess.html).
	- Modified osd_alloc_executable() to use mmap() by default.  This 
	  prevents segfaults in the DRC core on systems that support the NX 
	  bit, such as AMD64 and Intel Prescott.  Thanks to Julian Sikorski, 
	  Adam Moss, and Carl Fongheiser.
	- Fixed a segfault that occurred when LIRC was enabled but lirc_init 
	  returned an error value.  (Joe Quanaim)
	- Added "-[no]lirc" to enable or disable LIRC support.  (Joe Quanaim)
	- Fixed several buffer overruns that happened when overly-long data was 
	  passed for "-ctrlr", "-lang", "-rec", and "-pb".  Fixed other 
	  potential buffer overruns.  Bugzilla bug 821.
	- Files larger than 2GB can now be accessed on platforms with large 
	  file support.
	- The "-createhd" and "-merge" operations in chdman are now a lot 
	  faster on Linux.

Release 0.102, 25 November 2005
	- Everything from MAME 0.102 and MESS 0.102.
	- Fixed a bug that could afflict MESS console emulations by preventing 
	  the keyboard from working.
	- The default ALSA buffer size is now 50000ms instead of 250000ms, 
	  which reduces lag.
	- Advancing frame-by-frame using shift-P works again.  Bugzilla bug 
	  787.
	- Added more GCC -march settings for x86 CPUs to the makefile.
	- When the setup menu is closed, the keyboard state is cleared.  This 
	  prevents the key press that closes the menu from affecting the 
	  emulation.  This replaces the fix from 0.97, which wasn't working 
	  anymore and caused the frame-by-frame advancing to break besides. 

Release 0.101, 22 October 2005
	- Everything from MAME 0.101 and MESS 0.101.
	- The messtest application builds again.
	- When the LIRC configuration cannot be read, the joystick polling code 
	  no longer tries to use LIRC.  This fixes a crash that occurs under 
	  memory pressure.  (Paul "TBBle" Hampson)
	- Enabling full keyboard emulation in the classic MESS UI once again 
	  prevents keys such as P and Esc from being intercepted by the 
	  emulation core.
	- Added support for BGR visuals to the blit core for, e.g., Solaris.  
	  (Hans de Goede)

Release 0.100, 21 September 2005
	- Everything from MAME 0.100 and MESS 0.100.
	- Using "make install" no longer strips debug symbols from the 
	  executables.
	- Improved support for OpenBSD, including fixing audio on 8-bit sound 
	  cards.  (Claudio Castiglia)
	- Improved the SDL joystick driver so that it will work better with 
	  components identified as hat switches or trackballs.  (Dave Ahlswede)
	- Increased the maximum number of joystick axes from 8 to 16 to support 
	  the Gravis Xterminator joypad.  (Dave Ahlswede)

Release 0.99, 16 August 2005
	- Everything from MAME 0.99 and MESS 0.99.
	- The SVGAlib target no longer fails silently under certain conditions. 
	  (Hans de Goede)
	- Removed some unnecessary calls to exit() and fixed a few memory leaks 
	  in the X11, Xv, and effects code.  (Hans de Goede)
	- The SVGAlib driver now handles __svgalib_tty_fd == -1.  This allows 
	  it to work with newer releases of SVGAlib.  (Hans de Goede)
	- Removed "-xv/-xvext" from the manpage.  Bugzilla bug 535. (Erik 
	  Hovland)
	- Updated the joystick types in the manpage.  Bugzilla bug 737.
	- Fixed some typos in the documentation.  Bugzilla bug 738.  (Erik 
	  Hovland)

Release 0.97, 13 June 2005
	- Everything from MAME 0.97 and MESS 0.97.
	- When the emulation is unpaused, the keyboard state is cleared.  This 
	  prevents key presses from bleeding over from the user interface.
	- The SDL driver now uses the correct green mask for RGB 565.  This 
	  fixes a problem with SDL on DirectFB being unable to find a valid 
	  video mode.  (Uli H.)
	- The SDL driver now locks the video surface before retrieving the 
	  pointer to its memory.  This fixes a crash with SDL on DirectFB.  
	  (Uli H.)
	- Fixed a few spots in the code for 4.3 BSD, e.g., OpenStep on NeXT.
	- Fixed bugs in the Xv driver and the 6-tap effect that affected 
	  big-endian architectures.  (Hans de Goede)

Release 0.96, 10 May 2005
	- Everything from MAME 0.96 and MESS 0.96.
	- Fixed the RGB to YUV conversion used by the Xv driver so that it 
	  conforms to the CCIR digital component video specifications.  Fixes 
	  Bugzilla bug 691.  (Alex W. Jackson)
	- The rows of the OpenGL bitmap used for 16bpp games are no longer 
	  misaligned in some cases; nagano98 now displays without doubled 
	  lines.
	- The behavior of "-listgamelist" should once again match the Windows 
	  side with regard to case-insensitive sorting and the treatment of 
	  leading "The" and "Le".
	- When a specific joystick device is designated with "-joydevname 
	  (-jdev)", it is now always treated as the player 1 joystick.
	- The built-in profiler works again.  (Colin Howell)
	- The X11 build now properly sets the standard window properties.  
	  (Christian Birchinger's friend)

Release 0.95, 29 March 2005
	- Everything from MAME 0.95 and MESS 0.95 .
	- Fixed a couple of spelling errors in the xmame manpage.  (A. Costa)
	- Forcing Xv to use YV12 ("-force-yuv 2") no longer causes rotated 
	  games to segfault.  Fixes Bugzilla bug 679.
	- Fixed a bug in the OpenGL display target that could cause the bitmap 
	  to be skewed for some games, such as sfrush.
	- Hotkey effect switching works again for MESS consoles.  (Christopher 
	  Stone)
	- Fixed the aspect ratio of the MESS SuperVision driver so that it's 
	  quadratic.  (PeT)
	- Added a setting to the makefile to disable effects: DISABLE_EFFECTS.  
	  This makes the blit files compile much more quickly, especially for 
	  older releases of GCC, such as 2.95.3.  This may eventually become 
	  more finely grained, so that you can disable only certain effects or 
	  certain scale factors.

Release 0.94, 15 March 2005
	- Everything from MAME 0.94 and MESS 0.94.
	- The pause key works again in the input setup.  For keyboards that 
	  generate 119 instead of 101, there's now a PAUSE_KEY_119 option in 
	  the makefile.
	- Trying to load more devices of one kind than a MESS driver supports 
	  no longer results in a crash.
	- The messtest tool is no longer built by default.
	- Hotkeys for effect and mode switching are now enabled in xmess only 
	  when the MESS UI is active.
	- Fixed the output of '-listdevices' for xmess.  (Christopher Stone)
	- Installing the OpenGL cabinets now really works without requiring a 
	  symlink to src/unix/cab in the top-level directory.

Release 0.92, 23 February 2005
	- Everything from MAME 0.92 and MESS 0.92.
	- Fixed the lq2x and hq2x 3x3 effects with Xv.  (Hans de Goede)
	- Added double buffering to lq2x and hq2x when blitting directly to the 
	  framebuffer.  (Hans de Goede)
	- Added a hack for megatech games which by default hides the BIOS 
	  screen.  You can toggle between the game and BIOS screens with 
	  left-ctrl + left-shift + insert.  (Hans de Goede)
	- Fixed an error in the comment about CRLF in the makefile.  (André 
	  Majorel)
	- The label for the enter key in the input setup is now "ENTER" instead 
	  of "ENTE ".  (Dave Humphreys)
	- Fixed several problems with the front-end "-list" commands: The MESS 
	  commands could segfault, some commands' headers were misaligned, and 
	  "-listpalettesize" was causing the ROM list to print.
	- Worked around or fixed a double-free on exit in xmess.
	- Fixed a segfault on startup that occurred when four or more joysticks 
	  devices were found.
	- The SDL joystick driver now works with multiple joysticks attached.
	- Updated the MMX effects code.  (Richard Goedeken)
	- BUILD_EXPAT is now off by default in the makefile.
	- The OpenGL cabinets are once again installed in $XMAMEROOT/cab 
	  instead of $XMAMEROOT/src/unix/cab.
	- The MESS "Tape Control" menu item now only appears for machines which 
	  have a cassette device.  Selecting this item when there is no tape 
	  image specified now displays a message instead of causing a crash.  
	  (Dave Humphreys)
	- The SDL sound driver should produce much better output.  Also fixed a 
	  potential deadlock.

Release 0.90, 18 January 2005
	- Everything from MAME 0.90 and MESS 0.90.
	- The "-sleepidle (-si)" option is now enabled by default.  This keeps 
	  the emulation from hogging the CPU when it's idle.
	- Did a major rework of the effects code, which now borrows code from 
	  the AdvanceMAME project (Hans de Goede):
	  * The code is much cleaner.
	  * Effects are much faster on DGA.
	  * The scaling is no longer fixed to a certain factor for each 
	    effect: It supports normal (1x1 - 8x8), scale2x (2x2 - 3x6), scan2 
	    (1x2 - 4x2), rgbscan (1x3 - 6x3), scan3 (1x3 - 6x3), hq2x (2x2),
	    lq2x (2x2), 6tap2x (2x2).
	  * All the scanline effects come in both horizontal and vertical 
	    varieties, and vertical scanlines are automatically chosen for 
	    rotated games.
	- Made the 32bpp to yuy2 blitting code much faster and cleaner.  (Hans 
	  de Goede)
	- Made a small change to the OpenGL code that more than triples the 
	  speed of 16bpp games.  (Enik)
	- The install portion of the makefile no longer depends on the "cab" 
	  and "doc" symlinks in the top-level directory.
	- Enhanced LIRC support to compile and link against system-installed 
	  liblirc_client files.  Added the "-lircrc" option.  (Mads Villadsen)
	- Optimized some of the yuy2 blit functions.  (Hans de Goede)
	- Added CPU capability detection for Linux on x86.  Currently this only 
	  tests for MMX.  (Hans de Goede)
	- Changed the effects code to use the C versions of effects when a CPU 
	  isn't MMX-capable.  This means that binary distributions can be built 
	  with EFFECT_MMX_ASM defined and still run on older CPUs.  This 
	  presently only works for Linux on x86.  (Hans de Goede)
	- Fixed "-geometry (-geo)" to properly adhere to given window 
	  coordinates.  Added support for window coordinates to OpenGL.  (Hans 
	  de Goede)
	- By default, fullscreen mode now only spans screen 0.  To select 
	  another screen, use "-xinerama-screen <nr>", or use -1 if you want 
	  the old behavior where all screens are spanned.  (Joe Q. and Hans de 
	  Goede)
	- Removed Mesa on Glide on Voodoo 2 in fullscreen mode hack.  If you 
	  need this, just use "-geometry 640x480 -grabkeyboard -grabmouse" 
	  instead.  (Hans de Goede)
	- Reverted to treating lightgun buttons as mouse buttons, so lightguns 
	  will work independent of joystick devices or drivers.  It is now 
	  also assumed that there are always 5 mice connected, so multiple 
	  lightguns should work fine.
	- The old-style debugger works again.  (Hans de Goede)
	- Merged several of Nicola Salmoria's memory leak fixes from Windows 
	  MAME.
	- Fixed multiple port recording for the playback/record option.  (Chad 
	  Hurwitz)
	- The SVGAlib target now works for xmess: There was a clash with the PC 
	  emulation function vga_init().  (Dave Humphreys)

Release 0.89, 5 December 2004
	- Everything from MAME 0.89 and MESS 0.89.
	- Re-added a missing "Rapid Fire" entry from the setup menu that caused 
	  the other entries to be off by one.  Fixes Bugzilla bug 621.
	- Another batch from Hans de Goede:
	  * The GGI driver no longer crashes when $DISPLAY isn't set.
	  * SDL calls mode_set_aspect when using modes.
	  * The SDL and X11 drivers now ask the window manager to be notified 
	    of the user closing the window and exit cleanly.
	  * The SDL driver now supports "-alwaysusemouse (-aum)", 
	    "-grabinput (-gi)", and "-[no]cursor (-[no]cu)", as well as 
	    toggling input grabbing with left-ctrl + delete.
	  * The SDL driver now forces a fullscreen update every first update 
	    after a (re)open.  This prevents the left side of artwork 
	    disappearing when the scale and effect options are quickly cycled 
	    through.
	  * Cleaned up the X11 code to be more readable.
	  * Sped up the rgbscan effect (effect 4), especially for DGA.
	  * Fixed a problem with OpenGL that prevented it from working with the 
	    binary ATI driver.
	  * Reworked GLDEBUG and added NOGLCHECKS.  The old code didn't do any 
	    error checking when GLDEBUG was not defined.
	  * Modified the GL_CHECK_ERROR macro to be much faster, since it is 
	    now used in normal builds.
	  * OpenGL no longer opens libglut.so.  Rather, it gets the symbols 
	    directly from libGL, as was already done with libGLU.
	  * OpenGL development packages no longer need to be installed to use 
	    OpenGL.  libGL.so.1 and libGLU.so.1 are now loaded instead of 
	    libGL.so and libGLU.so.
	- Added LIRC support for remote controls, e.g., with MythTV.  (Andrew 
	  Chuah)
	- Fixed a typo that caused absolute analog axes to interfere with 
	  digital negative axes in the input setup.
	- Fixed NetBSD warnings reported by Krister Walfridsson.  (Only the 
	  lazy fix for now.)

Release 0.88, 9 November 2004
	- Everything from MAME 0.88 and MESS 0.88.
	- Highlights of this release (PLEASE READ) (video changes by Hans de 
	  Goede):
	  * Completely reorganized the video code.  The OpenStep and Photon2 
	    targets are broken as a result until someone fixes them, but the 
	    changes are well worth it.
	  * Renamed "-x11-mode (-x11)" to "-video-mode (-vidmod)". The help 
	    text for this option is now auto-generated based on which options 
	    are available.  This option is also used by non-X11 displays.
	  * The xgl and xfx drivers are now built into the X11 target, 
	    alongside Xv and DGA.  OpenGL can be selected at runtime with 
	    "-video-mode (-vidmod) 2", and Glide can be selected with 
	    "-video-mode (-vidmod) 3".
	  * Fullscreen mode is now enabled from the command line with 
	    "-fullscreen".
	  * Reworked the hotkeys for switching between X11 video modes and 
	    fullscreen and windowed modes: left-alt +
	    insert:    normal or DGA rendering
	    home:      Xv rendering
	    page up:   OpenGL rendering
	    delete:    Glide rendering
	    page down: toggle between windowed and fullscreen
	  * Changed the hotkeys for grabbing keyboard and mouse from left-alt + 
	    page up/page down to left-control + page up/page down.
	  * Added hotkey switching for effects: Use left-ctrl + page-up or 
	    page-down. Mouse and keyboard grabbing are now toggled with 
	    left-ctrl + del and left-ctrl + end, respectively.
	  * Added hotkeys for changing options for Open GL: left-ctrl + 
	    left-alt + :
	    insert:    toggle bilinear filtering
	    home:      toggle cabview
	    end:       toggle antialiasing
	    page up:   increase vector beam size
	    page down: decrease vector beam size
	    Left-ctrl + left-alt + insert also works for toggling bilinear 
	    filtering in Glide.
	  * Added an ALSA mixer plugin, which can be enabled with 
	    "-sound-mixer-plugin (-smp) alsa".  The new "-alsa-mixer (-amixer)" 
	    option accepts the name of a "simple mixer control", which you can 
	    find by executing "amixer".  (Shyouzou Sugitani)
	  * Changed JOY_I386 in the makefile to JOY_STANDARD.
	  * Removed support for the X11 joystick driver, which was broken 
	    anyway.
	  * The "-joytype (-jt)" list now only displays drivers that are 
	    compiled in. Note that some of the values have changed!
	- Another slew of changes from Hans de Goede:
	  * Added "-alwaysusemouse(-aum)" to the X11 driver.  If this is not 
	    set, mouse events won't be reported to the core when fullscreen 
	    mode is disabled and the mouse is not grabbed.
	  * The code for handling a grabbed mouse now uses the window size 
	    instead of the image size, which fixes problems when the Xv window 
	    is shrunk to less than half its original size.
	  * The in-game cursor no longer jumps when the mouse is grabbed. 
	  * BIG cleanup of the display code: Internal changes should 
	    theoretically allow the display drivers to be placed in shared 
	    object (.so) files and loaded dynamically.
	  * The game_bitmap_update bounds are now honored, resulting in a nice 
	    speedup for artwork games.
	  * The rounding of bounds is now only done for blitting to the 
	    offscreen image, and not for displaying on the screen.  This gets 
	    rid of the black borders in some games, such as mspacman with 
	    artwork enabled.
	  * The DGA code can now display any color depth on any depth just like 
	    normal windowed mode.
	  * The DGA 2.0 code now tries to obtain a mode with the best and 
	    fastest color depth; for example, a depth 15 mode for vector games, 
	    so that the entire bitmap can be copied straight into the 
	    framebuffer with no conversion.
	  * Fixed a small memory leak in the DGA 1.0 code.
	  * Made a small tweak to the Xv window size handling to avoid a small 
	    black border in Xv windowed mode.
	  * Now "-geometry (-geo)" sets not only the x- and y-coordinates, but 
	    also the window size when the window is resizable (xgl and Xv).  
	    The requested size gets clipped to the largest constrained size 
	    with the correct aspect ratio.
	  * Removed the "-fxres" option.  Glide now honors the window size 
	    passed with "-geometry (-geo)".
	  * Really fixed artwork with vector games in the Glide targets.
	  * Added a "-hwvec <int>" option:
	    0: Never use Glide/OpenGL vectors.
	    1: Auto (don't use when there is an artwork overlay).
	    2: Always use Glide/OpenGL vectors.
	  * Fixed rotation with artwork-enabled vector games in Glide targets.
	  * Force a full screen update so that artwork bezels get shown when 
	    DGA mode is enabled via hotkey.
	  * Prefer 16bpp deep modes over 15bpp deep modes when we must 
	    downsample from 32bpp; try to avoid 24bpp packed modes.
	  * Added a "-forcemode (-fm) WxHxD" option; this is intended mostly 
	    for testing purposes.
	  * The DGA 2.0 driver no longer uses fillsolidrectangle, which isn't 
	    supported on some cards, notably Radeons in 32bpp mode.  This is 
	    not in a speed-critical path, so memset is always used.
	  * The DGA 2.0 driver can now pageflip on vsync.  This fixes tearing 
	    in side-scrolling games and flashing in all games.  Added an option 
	    "-vsync-pagelimit (-vspl) <int>" with which the user can specify 
	    the maximum number of frames to queue in offscreen video memory for 
	    displaying on vsync; the default is 2, and 0 disables this feature. 
	    Note: When a game's FPS is higher than the refresh rate of the 
	    chosen video mode, the game will run slower or skip frames.
	  * Rewrote the OpenGL vector code, which now works with artwork 
	    (without overlays), supports clipping, fixes a number of bugs with 
	    cabinet mode, and generates shorter OpenGL command lists.
	  * Made the resizing of the OpenGL window not bound to the aspect when 
	    in cabinet mode.
	  * Don't resize the window for display methods that can do hardware 
	    scaling when the visual area of the game changes.  This fixes 
	    flashing with, for example, raystorm when Xv or OpenGL is used.
	  * Removed the definition of GLX_LIBNAME from the makefile; now it is 
	    always libglut.so.
	  * Removed TDFX_DGA_WORKAROUND from the makefile; this is now always 
	    enabled, since it shouldn't hurt cards which don't have the bug.
	  * Added a "-fxresolution (-fxres)" option for Glide: Now "-geometry 
	    (-geo)" can be used for hardware-scaled windows (Xv, OpenGL) 
	    without causing Glide to complain about an invalid resolution.
	  * Whenever possible, the display is no longer destroyed and recreated 
	    when settings change; only the window is resized or the video mode 
	    changed.
	  * Made XIL a separate X11 mode, which can be enabled with 
	    "-video-mode (-vidmod) 4" or left-alt + end.
	  * Fixed a rounding error which caused vector games to get a slightly 
	    different resolution than requested.
	  * Shuffled options somewhat so that the output of "-help" and 
	    "-showconfig (-sc)" is more logically ordered.
	  * Disabled the use of scanlines with yarbsize.
	  * Fixed a bug with double-buffered blitting which caused each line to 
	    be blitted twice.  This is a huge speedup for DGA.
	  * Config files are now parsed after checking for "-help", "-version", 
	    and "-manhelp".
	  * An error about being unable to open the display is no longer 
	    reported when "-help" or front-end options are used without X.
	  * For 2x and 3x width scales, pixels are now written in memory order, 
	    which speeds up scaling directly to the framebuffer a lot, since 
	    this makes use of write combining.
	  * Double buffering is no longer used for directly writing to hardware 
	    surfaces.
	  * When the source and destination pixels are the same and the width 
	    scale is 1, the rotation code now writes directly to the 
	    destination instead of to an intermediate buffer.
	  * Cleaned up the mode handling in the DGA 2.0 driver.
	  * Scanlines are now an effect (number 9) instead of being controlled 
	    by a separate option ("-scanlines").
	  * A brief message is now displayed when effects and other options are 
	    changed via hotkeys.
	  * Fixed a vector clipping bug in the Glide target.
	  * Core dumps are disabled when DGA is available, since dumping core 
	    with DGA leads to X server freezes.
	  * Fixed artwork not showing in OpenGL and Glide modes under certain 
	    circumstances. 
	  * Scanlines are now at the bottom of each line, an no longer halfway 
	    in certain cases.
	  * Only close and reopen the sound device if necessary.
	  * Align not only min_x but also max_x of the destination coordinates. 
	    This fixes screen corruption with DGA on certain buggy hardware.
	  * Fixed a problem with DGA where garbage would show on the right side 
	    of the screen for certain artwork.
	  * Handling failures in the video setup is now more graceful; this 
	    should make sure that the abort case doesn't get reached unless a 
	    system is running out of memory or the like.
	  * Fixed 16bpp to YUY2 blitting on 64-bit architectures.
	  * Fixed a bug in DGA2 which caused the border of artwork to be 
	    blitted each frame.
	  * Slightly reworked alignment handling in video drivers which can 
	    have different modes/resolutions (DGA, SVGAlib, SDL).
	  * Completely rewrote the SDL driver.  It's now much faster than 
	    before -- just as fast as the native X11 driver -- and has 100% 
	    support for fullscreen, effects, scaling, etc.
	  * A number of games should no longer segfault on AMD x86-64 systems.
	- The xml2info utility can now link against the system's libexpat, and 
	  no longer requires BUILD_EXPAT to be set.  Fixes Bugzilla bug 592.
	- Updated the CFLAGS for IRIX MIPSpro in the makefile.  (Brandon 
	  Corey)
	- Fixed the IRIX AL sound driver's 8-bit output and updated rate setup 
	  to deal with unsupported audio hardware rates.  (Brandon Corey)
	- Possibly fixed a crash that occurred when a second lightgun's button 
	  was pressed and XINPUT_DEVICES wasn't defined in the makefile.

Release 0.87, 3 October 2004
	- Everything from MAME 0.87 and MESS 0.87.  Christopher Stone's 
	  makefile support for MAGE has been added, but MAGE is not yet 
	  included.
	- Setting the display method to SDL again implies JOY_SDL.  It now also 
	  implies SOUND_SDL.
	- Reworked the video mode functions (Hans de Goede):
	  * Unified and moved the aspect ratio calculations from xgl, fx, and 
	    x11_window to mode.c since all display targets that support 
	    arbitrary scaling through hardware make use of this.
	  * Modified the code to use the aspect ratio supplied by the game 
	    driver instead of doing all kinds of magic.  This corrects, for 
	    example, the aspect ratio of 1942.
	  * Added a new option, "-perfectaspect (-pa)", which automatically 
	    sets yarbsize to honor the aspect ratio provided by the game 
	    driver.  This is disabled by default because it can cause scaling 
	    artifacts.
	  * When video modes are matched, the aspect ratio is now taken into 
	    account.
	- Made changes to the OpenGL target (Hans de Goede):
	  * Fixed a double-free bug that caused a segfault on exit.
	  * Disabled the hotkey for switching between fullscreen and windowed 
	    mode, since this is broken.
	  * Fixed the resizing code to always detect resizes: The old code 
	    sometimes missed a resize event, which caused the display and the 
	    window size to mismatch.
	  * Modified to use the unified aspect ratio code: Keep the correct 
	    aspect ratio when "-glres" or "-fullscreen" is used; honor 
	    "-keepaspect" and "-displayaspectratio"; calculate the correct 
	    aspect ratio for games with non-square pixels.
	  * When Mesa is used on a Voodoo 1 or 2, '-glres "640x480"' is 
	    automatically added to the command line.
	  * The mouse can be grabbed when it is requested by the user or when 
	    fullscreen mode is used.
	  * The keyboard can now be grabbed.
	  * The mouse and keyboard are always grabbed when OpenGL on Glide is 
	    used.
	- Made changes to the X11 targets (Hans de Goede):
	  * Restored widthscale == 2 YUY2 code for perfect YUY2 blitting. 
	  * Fixed a bug introduced by the aspect ratio patches which caused the 
	    Xv fallback code to not detect an error case and crash later on 
	    instead of falling back to MITSHM.
	  * The Xv window is now resized with the correct aspect ratio after a 
	    user resize; this prevents black borders from appearing.
	  * Renamed "-perfect-yv12" to "-perfect-yuv".
	  * Enabled perfect blitting by default for YUY2, since it fixes the 
	    ugly color bleeding in, for example, pacman.
	  * Removed unused SGI pause map/unmap code.
	  * Don't resize the window when testing Xv during image creation.
	  * Unified keyboard and mouse grabbing and cursor setup.
	  * Fixed colors being way off in Xv for 15bpp direct games, e.g., 
	    vector games with artwork disabled.
	  * Current mouse values are now initialized in xinput_open, which 
	    should fix the problem of the visor going to the lower right corner
	    in starwars when the video mode is switched from windowed X11 to 
	    DGA fullscreen while the mouse is grabbed.
	  * Undid a change from 0.86 that caused the display to be closed twice 
	    when there was a creation failure.
	  * Fixed the display of a 32bpp source on a 24bpp packed pixel window.
	  * Fixed a bug in the DGA2 target which caused it to throw an XError 
	    when it failed to find a suitable mode, causing xmame to abort.
	  * XInput now maps controls to mice 2 - 5 and leaves mouse 1 free for 
	    the default mouse.  (Hans de Goede)
	  * Moved the XInput code from joystick-drivers/XInputDevices.[ch] to 
	    video-drivers/xinput.c.  (Hans de Goede)
	  * Unified window creation and window hints code.
	  * Did a major cleanup of the xfx target, which now uses the unified 
	    window code.
	  * The xfx target now also always grabs the mouse and keyboard, since 
	    losing focus when the Voodoo is controlling the monitor is not 
	    good.
	  * Fixed a bug which caused the window to disappear with Xv windowed 
	    mode under KDE.
	- Fixed a crash in the svgalib and svgafx targets that occurred when 
	  the mouse couldn't be opened.  (Hans de Goede)
	- Arbitrary Y scaling is now disabled when the debugger is used.  (Hans 
	  de Goede)
	- Added a missing "Rapid Fire" string to the configuration menu.  This 
	  fixes problems with the configuration of player controls.  (Sylvain 
	  Trosset)
	- The two aRts sound plugins can now co-exist; their names for the 
	  "-dsp_plugin (-dp)" option are "arts_smotek" and "arts_teira".  Fixes 
	  Bugzilla bug 591.
	- Added a flag (LIGHTGUN_DEFINE_INPUT_ABSINFO) to the makefile to 
	  determine whether struct input_absinfo needs to be defined, since we 
	  can't seem to decide this based on the version of the Linux headers.
	- Cleaned up the sound code (Hans de Goede):
	  * Cleaned up the ALSA driver.
	  * The ALSA driver now reports the actual sample rate to the caller 
	    rather than the requested one.
	  * Removed the "-alsa-pcm" command line option; the ALSA driver now 
	    supports "-auviodevice (-ad)".  (Hans de Goede)
	  * Removed "-fakesound (-fsnd)".  Now sound is always faked since 
	    certain games won't run without it.
	  * Changed the default sample rate to 44100, moving us into the 
	    Third Millennium.
	  * Removed the "-[no]sound" option; if you really want to disable 
	    sound, specify a bogus device with "-audiodevice".
	- Cleaned up some of the rc-parsing code.  (Hans de Goede)
	- Removed the "-[no]mouse" option.  (Hans de Goede)
	- Fixed problems with building when Glide2 is enabled in the makefile.
	  (Mark Nipper)
	- When fullscreen mode is enabled, the event queue is first emptied.  
	  (Hans de Goede)
	- Added support for setting the keyboard LEDs.  For this to work, you 
	  need to edit /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xkb/compat/basic and change the 
	  value of indicator.allowExplicit from False to True and then restart
	  your X server.  Note that apps can only force the LEDs on, not off, 
	  so make sure all the LEDs are off before you run xmame.  (Hans de 
	  Goede)
	- Remember if the grabbed mouse or keyboard state was changed with 
	  hotkeys so that it can be restored when switching to fullscreen mode 
	  and back.  (Hans de Goede)
	- Removed a lot of cruft from the palette code, which now also 
	  creates the yuyv lookup table when necessary.  (Hans de Goede)
	- Catch fatal signals (abort, segfault, etc.) in the xfx and svgafx 
	  targets and restore the Voodoo passthrough display before crashing.  
	  (Hans de Goede)
	- The GGI target builds again.
	- Cleaned up and otherwise modified the blit and effect code (Hans de 
	  Goede):
	  * Removed a lot of 8bpp cruft.
	  * Cleaned up and pared down the effects code.
	  * Fixed a bug in blit_effect.h where each third line of 3x effects 
	    never got drawn when double buffering was not being used.
	  * When double buffering is used and the destination screen is wider 
	    than the scaled game (DGA), only render and copy the visible part, 
	    not the black areas.
	  * Fixed a bug in effect 5 which showed up in palettized games.
	  * Fixed effects with SVGAlib.
	  * The effects code should compile more easily on machines with low 
	    memory.
	  * The effects now support 15bpp for X11 and SVGAlib.
	  * Added YUY2 support to the 6-tap effect.
	  * Trying to use an effect that isn't supported on a particular 
	    display now reports a message and disabled the effect.
	  * The effects now check for failed mallocs.
	  * Switched off double buffering for effects, since this was just a 
	    source of slowdown.
	- The X11 target builds again when X11_XV isn't set in the makefile.  
	  Fixes Bugzilla bug 598.  (alito)
	- The OpenGL target's "-glaa" option is now disabled by default since 
	  it's terribly slow when it's not supported in hardware.  (Hans de 
	  Goede)
	- Split aspect and mode settings so that all targets can use the 
	  aspect settings.  (Hans de Goede)
	- Ported the following change from Windows MAME: 'Added the ability for 
	  analog axes to return "invalid" as a value from the OSD layer, 
	  allowing them to dynamically disable themselves.  Using this feature, 
	  the Windows version now autodetects analog versus digital axes and 
	  dynamically disables the analog values if it thinks you are using a 
	  digital axis.  Note that this even works if you have a "switchable" 
	  gamepad.  [Aaron Giles]'
	- Fixed the mapping of analog sticks' min..max ranges to the core's 
	  range.  This fixes games that use analog controls, such as Out Run, 
	  as well as the jittery movement of the mouse cursor in games such as 
	  Missile Command.
	- Audio should work much better on Mac OS X.  (anonymous)
	- The MMX assembly language version of the 6-tap filter now works for 
	  16 and 32bpp source and destination bitmaps; previously, only the 
	  32bpp screen depth was accelerated.  (Richard Goedeken)
	- Corrected some of the out-of-date information in the documentation.  
	  Fixes Bugzilla bug 604.
	- Light guns should work again.  Also added support for the triggers on 
	  an ACT LABS USB PC Monitor model that didn't work previously.

Release 0.86, 25 August 2004
	- Everything from MAME 0.86 and MESS 0.86.
	- The SVGAlib target links again.
	- Fixed redefinition warnings in src/sha1.[ch].  (Krister Walfridsson)
	- Fixed buffer overruns in the effects and rotation code that caused a 
	  segfault on exit for some games with artwork enabled.
	- Fixed memory leaks in the effects and rotation code that occurred 
	  when the display settings changed.
	- XInput was probably limited to two controllers in 0.85, but should 
	  again support up to four.
	- Overhauled the 3Dfx targets (Hans de Goede):
	  * Fixed a crash when 16bbpp palettized modes are used.
	  * Added support for rotated/flipped games.
	  * Corrected the paused emulation test.
	  * Added support for compiling and linking against Glide3.
	  * Fixed and cleaned up vector support.
	  * Added support for vector clipping, which fixes mhavoc.
	  * Fixed 32bpp game support.
	  * Boosted the speed of 15bpp direct RGB games by avoiding a table 
	    lookup.
	  * Modified 15bpp direct RGB support to use memcpy for a small 
	    speedup. 
	  * Fixed support for non-square pixel games; for example, blstroid.
	- Overhauled the OpenGL target.  Fixes Bugzilla bug 109.   (Hans de 
	  Goede):
	  * Fixed vector support, with the exception of clipping; for an 
	    example of the problem, see mhavoc.
	  * Removed 8bpp support, paletted texture support, dirty code, and 
	    some useless options.
	  * Fixed a lot of buffer overruns.
	- The SVGAlib targets now detect the signals used for console 
	  switching.  (Hans de Goede)
	- When "-norotate (-nr)" is specified, the UI is no longer rotated 
	  relative to the game.  (Hans de Goede)
	- Did major cleanup of the blit core (Hans de Goede):
	  * Rotation should be a bit faster.  
	  * Defining DEST is no longer optional; targets that don't define it 
	    will need to be fixed.  
	  * Removed a bunch of obsolete #defines and special cases.
	  * Removed fixed Y scaling, since the arbitrary Y scaling is not 
	    noticeably slower.
	  * Removed LOW_MEM from the makefile; blit.h is now so small, it 
	    should no longer be needed.
	- The C version of the 6-tap filter rotates pointers now instead of 
	  using memcpy, which should give a small speed boost.  It also no 
	  longer reallocates a rotation buffer.  (Hans de Goede)
	- Fixed a bunch of unused variable warnings.  (Hans de Goede)
	- XInput now works with the xgl target.
	- The SDL joystick driver works again.  It should also be a bit faster. 
	- Adjusted a few tests to make sure that every combination of compiling 
	  in XIL, MITSHM, and Xv will work and that the fallback order is Xv -> 
	  MITSHM -> normal X11.  (Hans de Goede)
	- The Xv driver no longer uses "-geometry", since this requires users 
	  to know the aspect ratio of a game.  It instead uses "-widthscale" 
	  and "-heightscale".  (Hans de Goede)
	- Added "-perfect-yv12", which uses perfect Xv YV12 scaling instead of 
	  the widthscale == 2 && heightscale == 2 hack.  (Hans de Goede)
	- Added support for displaying 32bpp bitmaps on a 16bpp X11 or 3Dfx 
	  display by down-sampling.  (Hans de Goede)
	- Added rotation for Xv YV12 displays.  (Hans de Goede)
	- Sometimes Xv Image creation succeeds, but the first XvShmPutImage to 
	  a mapped window fails with a BadAlloc error; also, sometimes it can 
	  create an Image smaller than the requested size.  In such cases, the 
	  code now falls back to another Image type instead of crashing later.  
	  (Hans de Goede)
	- Fixed problems in the X11 display target (Hans de Goede):
	  * Free cursors on close.
	  * Call close when display creation fails to clean up after us.
	  * Comment out sleep calls, which shouldn't be necessary since XSync 
	    should only exit after everything has been processed.
	  * Removed x11_window_put_image in favor of x11_window_refresh_screen 
	    since dirty rectangles are no longer supported.
	  * Worked around an X11 bug that caused keys to get stuck when 
	    fullscreen DGA mode was exited.
	- The display should no longer open twice for artwork games: The setup 
	  code wasn't rounding the display bounds as it should have.
	- Effects now use CORRECTED_DEST_WIDTH and *may* work with PACKEDPIXEL 
	  modes.  (Hans de Goede)
	- Adjusted the display bounds rounding so that the resulting rectangle 
	  is at least as large as the original.  This prevents the cutoff on 
	  the right side of the intro screen for, e.g., pacman with artwork.
	- Fixed problems with aspect ratio calculation (Hans de Goede):
	  * Fixed problems with SVGAlib, DGA, and possibly other display 
	    targets when arbitrary Y scaling was used.
	  * Games whose bitmap isn't 4:3, such as pacman and moo, no longer 
	    show black borders with Xv.
	  * Added correct aspect ratio calculation to Xv when games have double 
	    width or double height pixels; for example, blstroid.
	  * The Xv aspect ratio honors "-displayaspectratio".
	  * Removed the "-widescreen" option in favor of "-displayaspectratio 
	    1.77".
	  * Pixel width and height doubling is now correct when 
	    "-[auto]ro{r|l}" is used.
	- The "-bpp" option now only supports 15 or 32.  (Hans de Goede)
	- Fixed some ANSI/ISO warnings about the "%m" printf format identifier 
	  and empty joystick and sound source files.
	- Joystick buttons are no longer always registered as "button 9" in the 
	  configuration menu.  Fixes Bugzilla bug 587.  (Thomas Klausner)
	- Modified support for vector games in the OpenGL and 3Dfx targets 
	  (Hans de Goede): 
	  * Only update the textures in vector games when the UI is running.  
	    This results in a tremendous speedup.
	  * Draw very short lines as points; this makes the bullets in 
	    Asteroids show up.
	  * Disabled bezels and overlays; enabled "-artwork_crop (-artcrop)".
	- Created a means for display drivers to communicate their properties 
	  to the rest of the program; for example, whether they have their own 
	  vector implementation and whether they do hardware rotation.  (Hans 
	  de Goede)

Release 0.85, 12 August 2004
	- Everything from MAME 0.85 and MESS 0.85.
	- Fixed a problem in makefile.unix that prevented the xgl target from 
	  building.
	- Those who have the commercial NVIDIA driver installed can now build 
	  the xgl target without having to install the Mesa headers.  (Jonas 
	  Laurio and me).
	- Adjusted the LinuxPPC compile and link flags to prevent relocation 
	  errors resulting from the application being too large for 24-bit 
	  offsets in branch instructions.  (Christian Groessler)
	- Improved the NetBSD USB joystick driver: Added support for up to 8 
	  axes and 1 hat and made manual calibration optional via the command 
	  line option "-joyusb-calibrate".  (Dieter Baron)
	- Building xmess.xgl no longer results in link errors from messtest.
	- Added a 2x sinc-based 6-tap filter effect with scanlines, enabled 
	  via "-effect 8" or "-ef 8".  (Richard Goedeken)
	- Added EFFECT_MMX_ASM to the makefile, which enables MMX versions of 
	  the "light scanlines" and "6-tap filter" effects.  (Richard Goedeken)
	- You can now successfully build with LIGHTGUN_ABS_EVENT enabled on 
	  systems with Linux 2.6 headers.
	- Fixed a problem that prevented xml2info from building.  (Shyouzou 
	  Sugitani)
	- Reworked the input code so that it more closely resembles its Windows 
	  counterpart.  This adds support for "-steadykey", "-a2d_deadzone" and 
	  "-digital".
	- Increased the maximum number of joysticks from 6 to 8 and the maximum 
	  number of buttons per joystick from 16 to 32.
	- Mouse buttons may not have been working in recent releases for games 
	  such as Missile Command; they should work now.
	- Network support is broken for the time being because of the core 
	  input changes, so please disable XMAME_NET in your makefile.  If 
	  you're interested in fixing this, have a look at src/unix/network.c 
	  and the XMAME_NET sections of an older src/inptport.c.
	- Fixed a 1000-fold inaccuracy in the BeOS implementation of usleep().
	  (Jack Burton)

Release 0.84.1, 17 July 2004
	- Everything from MAME 0.84 and MESS 0.84.
	- Removed "-listinfo", since it's no longer supported by the core. 
	- The support for network play and rapidfire is no longer in vanilla 
	  MAME, so they have to be patched into the core for releases.
	- Builds on LinuxPPC should no longer give warnings about "PPC" being
	  redefined.
	- Removed romalizer from src/unix/contrib/tools since it has been 
	  abandoned.
	- Reworked the makefiles so that dirtied files in src/unix are once 
	  again compiled and force the application to relink.  It also seems to 
	  behave well with parallel (-j) invocations of 'make'.
	- Enabled messtest in src/unix/unix.mak since it should now build 
	  without errors with 'make -j'.

Release 0.83.1, 12 June 2004
	- Everything from MAME 0.83 and MESS 0.83.
	- The Xv driver now turns on XV_AUTOPAINT_COLORKEY, in case it was 
	  turned off by, for example, by the xine movie player.  This prevents 
	  the display from being blank in this case.  (Shyouzou Sugitani)
	- Moved a misplaced vprintf() call that was causing a bunch of log 
	  messages to display and slowing down the emulation for some games.

Release 0.82.1, 15 May 2004
	- Everything from MAME 0.82 and MESS 0.82.
	- The romcmp tool now builds on Solaris.
	- Improved the message that is displayed when a suitable X11 visual 
	  cannot be found.  Fixes Bugzilla bug 219.  (Christopher Stone)
	- Fixed the most egregious formatting errors in the xmame.6 manpage.  
	  (André Majorel)
	- Converted the documentation from LinuxDoc to a more modern DocBook 
	  format.
	- Added x86 SIMD options to the makefile.  (Patrick Roberts)

Release 0.81.1, 11 April 2004
	- Everything from MAME 0.81 and MESS 0.81.
	- Fixed a problem with the lightgun offscreen reloading that caused a 
	  random shot every fourth or fifth shot.  (Joe Inkenbrandt)
	- The prep-new-mame and prep-new-mess scripts now support dos2unix 
	  instead of just d2u.
	- Restructured the makefiles a bit so that object directories are 
	  created before compilation begins.  This should take care of the 
	  problems with parallel compilation.  Thanks to Arnaud G. Gibert for 
	  much help and critique.
	- Fixed a crash that occurred when Xv was enabled and DISPLAY was 
	  pointing to a remote screen.  (Krister Walfridsson)

Release 0.80.1, 13 March 2004
	- Everything from MAME 0.80 and MESS 0.80.
	- Improved support for GNU make's -j option, which can especially 
	  benefit SMP and SMT machines.  (Arnaud G. Gibert)

Release 0.79.1, 19 February 2004
	- Everything from MAME 0.79 and MESS 0.79.
	- Added a missing osd_die() definition.  Without this, OpenVMS was 
	  reporting a compile error.
	- More changes to support OpenVMS.  (Robert Alan Byer)
	- Updated the ALSA DSP module to use the ALSA 1.0 API.  (Shyouzou 
	  Sugitani)
	- Paths now allow a literal "$" if it's preceded by "\".  (André 
	  Majorel)
	- The JOY_SDL option should now actually work with non-SDL targets.  
	  (Gorka Olaizola)
	- Fixed a segfault that occurred when "-debug" was used with a rotated 
	  game.
	- The debugger window should no longer be blank for 32bpp games.
	- Fixed a bug in fix-comments.c that was causing it to mangle 
	  src/drivers/vendetta.c.
	- When XINPUT is defined in the makefile but no XInput devices are 
	  configured, the mouse is treated as a trackball.  (Gerd Sussner)
	- Added SYSCONFDIR to the makefile to specify a path for systemwide 
	  configuration files.  (Nicos Panayides)
	- Hacked support for CHD files into the mame-cd script in the contrib 
	  tools directory.  Also fixed a few small bugs.
	- The Xv YUV code should now work on big-endian platforms.  (Maciej J. 
	  Woloszyk)
	- Removed "neomame" and "cpsmame" as targets from the makefile since the
	  core no longer supports them.
	- The trigger for the ACT LABS TV light gun now works; reloading now 
	  requires only one offscreen shot instead of two.  (Joe Inkenbrandt)

Release 0.78.1, 13 January 2004
	- Everything from MAME 0.78 and MESS 0.78.
	- You can now "make tools" without first having to "make osdepend".  
	  Fixed a couple of minor problems with src/unix/Makefile and 
	  src/unix/unix.mak.  (Adam Di Carlo)
	- Rearranged a bit of code to allow the MESS tools to build.
	- Added JOY_SDL to the makefile so that the SDL joystick plugin can be
	  enabled for non-SDL targets.  The SDL target still enables the plugin
	  without requiring JOY_SDL to be set.
	- The ALSA module now builds against ALSA 1.0.  Fixes Bugzilla bug 501.
	- Changed the abbreviation of "-pause_brightness" to "-pbrt" to prevent
	  a conflict with "-playback".
	- Added double buffering, enabled via "-doublebuf", to the SDL target.  
	  (Thomas Jarosch)
	- Deprecated the SDL target's "-modenumber" in favor of "-vidmode_w" and 	  "-vidmode_h".  (Thomas Jarosch)
	- Updated the included zlib library to 1.2.1, which should be faster 
	  than 1.1.4.
	- Fixed an infrequent spurious error reported by zlib 1.2.1.  (Mark 
	  Adler)
	- OpenVMS support should be close now.  (Robert Alan Byer)
	- Changed the man path to $(PREFIX)/man/man6, which is more 
	  FHS-compliant according to André Majorel.

Release 0.77.1, 18 November 2003
	- Everything from MAME 0.77 and MESS 0.77.
	- Ported two more effects from AdvanceMAME: hq2x and lq2x.  (Pieter 
	  Hulshoff)
	- Adjusted and cleaned up some YUV code.  (Alastair Robinson)
	- The SDL video mode search now stops if it finds the exact resolution 
	  requested.  (Thomas Jarosch)
	- Improved the Superboard II emulation in xmess.  For details, see
	  http://claudio.ch/SuperboardII/  (Claudio Nieder)
	- Added support for the Solaris joystick driver available from 
	  http://www.bolthole.com/solaris/drivers/  (Philip Brown)

Release 0.76.1, 25 October 2003
	- Everything from MAME 0.76 and MESS CVS.
	- The I/O section of the xmess manpage should be more up-to-date.
	- Linux input devices that support absolute X/Y events -- light guns, 
	  tablets, and touchpads -- can now be treated as light guns.  See 
	  LIGHTGUN_ABS_EVENT in the makefile.  (Ben Collins)
	- Added Opteron/Athlon64 as a CPU option in the makefile.  (Caleb Shay)
	- Added a LOW_MEM option to the makefile that prevents a memory 
	  explosion when compiling such files as x11_window.c with GCC 2.x.  
	  (NetBSD pkgsrc tree)
	- A leading '.' on a path now causes xmess to treat it as absolute.  
	  This allows "xmess.x11 nes -cart ./zelda.zip" to work.
	- Set options.mess_printf_output so that xmess spits out more 
	  informative error messages, e.g., when it's unable to load an image.
	- The "-list-dsp-plugins (-ldp)" and "-list-mixer-plugins (-lmp)" 
	  commands now cause the program to exit with a return value of 0.

Release 0.74.1, 15 September 2003
	- Everything from MAME 0.74 and MESS CVS.
	- Reapplied David Mitchell's fix for the XInput inertial effect when 
	  a mouse or spinner is used.  (Jake Stookey)
	- Added support for controllor setup via "-ctrlr".  Note that "-hotrod"
	  and "-hotrodse" have been replaced by "-ctrlr HotRod" and "-ctlrlr 
	  HotRodSE".
	- Added support for the Sun Forte 7 C compiler.  (Greg Menke)

	- The rc parsing code displays more compact and readable error messages.
	  (André Majorel)
	- Xv windowed mode is now enabled with "-x11-mode 2" or "-x11 2", and 
	  Xv fullscreen mode is enabled with "-x11-mode 3" or "-x11 3".  The 
	  "-[no]xv" and "-fullscreen" switches are no longer available for X11 
	  builds.
	- Networking should work again.  I'd forgotten to change instances of 
	  MAME_NET in src/unix to XMAME_NET in the 0.70.1 release.
	- Added hotkey switching for Xv windowed mode via ALT + DEL and Xv 
	  fullscreen mode via ALT + END.
	- The xfx target should build again.

	  'src/includes'.  Fixes Bugzilla bug 435.
	- The man page xmame.6 is much more up-to-date.  (Andrew Burton)
	- Fixed errors reported for xmame.6 on a Debian Woody system.  (Alex 
	  Kirk)

Release 0.70.1, 18 June 2003
	- Almost everything from MAME 0.70 and MESS 0.70.
	- Changed an instance of MAME_DEBUG to DEBUG in unix.mak.  (Christopher
	  Stone)
	- Removed an obsolete (?) #include from osdutils.h that was interfering
	  with MESS debug and IRIX builds.  Fixes Bugzilla bug #385.  (Frank 
	  Everdij, Christopher Stone)
	- Fixed some unused variable warnings when building non-debug versions
	  of glgen.c and esound.c.
	- Fixed the default values for "-sysinfo_file" and "-messinfo_file", 
	  which were missing a '/'.
	- Fixed the handling of leading zeros in the fractional part of a float
	  in src/unix/snprintf.c.  (Chris Kirmse)
	- Building 'tools' for xmess works again.
	- Reduced the core changes needed to support networking, rapidfire, and

	  changed to XMAME_NET.
	- The numeric keypad '*' key is now mapped correctly for SDL builds.
	- The GLmame version string is now printed to stderr instead of stdout,
	  as suggested by Matthias Saou.

	- Re-added Ben Collins' core change that adds support for extra mice.
	- Rearranged the doc directory so that MAME- and MESS-specific files are
	  in their own subdirectories.
	- Reverted to using the original fronthlp.c (from 0.67.2) modified to 
	  work with the 0.69 core.
	- Building with the debugger enabled now works.  Note that in the 
	  makefile, MAME_DEBUG is now just DEBUG.  (Christopher Stone)
	- Fixed a logic bug in the XInput devices button-handling.  (Ben 
	  Collins)
	- Added UGCI coin/play support based on the libugci library for Linux's
	  HIDDevice layer.  See http://www.phunnypharm.org/ugci/  (Ben Collins)
	- Building the neomame target works again.  (Steve Behling)
	- Made a tiny fix in fileio.c that allows specifying direct paths to 
	  roms to work again; e.g., ./xmame.x11 ./moo.zip

Release 0.68.1, 22 May 2003
	- Almost everything from MAME 0.68 and MESS 0.68.
	- Fixed the analog joystick support so that the Y-axis is recognized as
	  analog.  (Sebastien Devaux)

	  Collins)
	- Made a less intrusive change to fm.c which removes LFO support in 
	  YM2610-only builds.  (Jarek Burczynski)
	- Fixed a few problems with "-listinfo" output.  (Andrea Mazzoleni)

Release 0.67.2, 12 April 2003
	- Fixed a bug in unix.mak that caused libusb to be linked in when the 
	  USB joystick driver was not enabled.
	- The makefile should now handle the CC variable correctly if it's some
	  variation of 'gcc', such as 'gcc-2.95.3'.
	- The MIPS x86 dynamic recompiling core now builds with GCC 2.95.x.
	- Fixed several other warnings and errors that occurred when building 
	  with GCC 2.95.x.
	- INSTALL_MAN_DIR in the makefile now uses INSTALL_GROUP for the gid 
	  instead of 0.
	- Fixed several C++-style comments and a couple of warnings in the 
	  OpenGL code.
	- Fixed a build error in the xmess.xgl target.

	  suid bit on the executable.  (Christopher Stone)
	- The Barath frameskipper is now enabled by default.  (suggested by 
	  Christopher Stone)
	- Fixed the use of 'sdl-config' in src/unix/unix.mak on platforms such 
	  as FreeBSD.  (Stijn Hoop)
	- Rotation has been moved to the blit core and should be a lot faster. 
	  (Shyouzou Sugitani)
	- Updated the GLmame driver to 0.94, which supports hardware bitmap 
	  rotation and should fix the OpenGL problems that have affected recent
	  releases.  (Sven Goethel)
	- Analog controls work again, and the analog code is now synced up with
	  the Windows code.  (Sebastien Devaux)
	- The "-joydev" switch now allows a full device name, such as 
	  /dev/input/js0, to be specified.
	- Added makecd_mame2.pl to contrib tools; this script aids with burning
	  CDs with ROMs, flyers, and cabinets.  (Luc Saillard)
	- Renamed "-gamma-correction" to "-gamma" to be consistent with the 
	  Win32 version.  It should also work now.
	- An Xv-enabled build should no longer report 0 bits per pixel and stop
	  on a display that doesn't support the Xv extension.  (Alexander 
	  Miller)
	- The "-brightness" switch now works as in Windows.  Removed obsolete 
	  brightness and gamma code from sysdep_palette.
	- Idle sleeping is now disabled while the onscreen configuration menu 
	  is displayed.  This works around a problem with key and button 
	  presses not registering when setting input preferences.
	- The "-record" and "-playback" switches now work as in the Win32 
	  version.  Also, the "inp" directory is now created on startup if 
	  it is missing.
	- MAME's disassemblers are no longer built by default.  This avoids  
	  having to make some ugly little patches to the core.  (Christopher 
	  Stone)
	- Removed the obsolete 8bpp update functions from most of the targets.  
	  This should speed compilation and produce a smaller binary.

Release 0.65.1, 11 February 2003
	- Almost everything from MAME 0.65 and MESS CVS.
	- Removed support for the ALSA 0.5 plugin.  (Shyouzou Sugitani)
	- The default path for data files in the example rc files, docs, and 
	  several scripts is now more FHS-compliant.  (Reported by anarxia.)
	- Disabled XScreenSaver support because it can cause the game window to
	  not open when running in KDE.  (Christopher Stone)
	- Reworked makefile.unix with the intent of making it a bit cleaner and
	  easier to tweak.
	- hdcomp now builds via "make -f makefile.unix tools".
	- Removed most Windows- and MS-DOS-specific files.

	- The game window should no longer open twice on startup in most cases.
	  One known exception is Pac-Man with artwork enabled.
	- Replaced fileio.c with a slightly modified version from the Win32 
	  codebase.  Be aware that several command line switches have changed 
	  as a result!
	- Applied the Xv cleanup patch required for the VIDIX patch.  (Alastair 
	  Robinson)
	- The number of games is no longer hard-coded to 3000 in datafile.c.  
	  This should fix problems with history.dat and "-listinfo".  (Rene 
	  Single)
	- Rotation is now handled by the OSD code.  The method used is hardly 
	  optimal, but it should work for all display targets.  Moving the 
	  rotation to the blit core is planned for a future release.
	- The Xv target now uses the game driver's aspect ratio unless the 
	  "-nokeepaspect" or "-noka" switch is specified.  Inspired by Paul 
	  Sajecki's patch.
	- Simplified/unified the FPS on-screen display.  This is now only 
	  overridden when the Barath frameskipper is in debug mode.
	- The DGA, GGI, and SVGALIB targets now use the game aspect ratio 
	  provided by the core rather than a hard-coded 4:3.
	- Using "-x11-mode" or "-x11" to activate DGA fullscreen mode now 
	  disables Xv.  Likewise, switching to DGA fullscreen mode via <ALT>-
	  <HOME> is now disabled while Xv is active.
	- All path and directory options in fileio.c now support expansion of 
	  environment variables such as $HOME.
	- Fixed a warning about snprintf when building for Mac OS X.
	- Fixed the XInput handling so that spinners no longer show an inertial
	  effect.  (David Mitchell)
	- Updated the documentation to include a section about the Xv extension.
	  (Frank Cox)
	- Fixed problems in memory.c that could lead to crashes and default.cfg
	  corruption.  (smf)
	- Fixed a bunch of ANSI/ISO warnings reported by Stefano Priore.
	- Aspect and mode switches are now available for the Xv driver even if 
	  DGA isn't enabled.
	- Fixed a couple of files so that they include <alsa/asoundlib.h> 
	  instead of the deprecated <sys/asoundlib.h>.  (Nico)
	- Changed a net_active() call in src/mame.c to the osd_net_active().  I 
	  must have messed up my all-in-one core patch at some point.
	- The 'rc' and 'hi' directories are now created on startup if they're 
	  missing.  (Gerd Sussner)
	- Merged NetMAME 0.6rc1, which should allow games to be playable over 
	  medium-latency connections, DSL, and cable.  It also adds configurable
	  ports and NVRAM sync.  (Steve Freeland)

Release 0.61.1, 13 November 2002

	  (Stijn Hoop)
	- Applied the NetMAME 0.5 patch, which adds a new option, 
	  "-parallelsync", which should allow games to work without lag at 
	  network latencies of up to 16 milliseconds.  (Steve Freeland)
	- Added support for Linux on the Playstation 2.  (Joan Sarah Touzet)
	- Fixed a problem in the ALSA 0.9 driver with setting the sample rate 
	  on SB128 soundcards.  (Stephen Anthony)
	- Fixed a bug in unix/devices.h that prevented compilation on non-X11 
	  platforms.
	- Fixed the register constraints in cpu/i8085/i8085cpu.h so that 
	  cpu/i8085/i8085.c can build for x86 using gcc-3.1 with -O3.  This 
	  change was missed in the MAME 0.61 release.
	- Fixed multiple definition warnings in the psikyosh driver.
	- Increased the size of the buffer used to display history.  (Steve 
	  Fewell)
	- Modified unix/fronthlp.c so that it flushes its output more often to 
	  aid frontends.  (Shadow Walker)
	- Changed unix/video-drivers/xfx.c to be more frontend-friendly.  
	  (Benoit Dumont)
	- Added support for the SDL joystick driver.  (Yang Hyun)
	- You can now specify a config subdirectory name using -cfgname/-cn.  
	  This is useful for creating an alternate configuration.  (Benoit 
	  Dumont)
	- Added a "waveout" DSP plugin which redirects sound to a file using 
	  Microsoft's PCM WAVE format.  The file name can be specified with the 
	  "-audiodevice" switch and defaults to "xmameout.wav".  (Donald King)
	- Added support for showing average frames per second when quitting.  
	  Also added support for the "-frames_to_run (-ftr)" switch.
	- Added Xv hardware scaling support!  To enable, uncomment the line 
	  reading "X11_XV = 1" in the makefile and use the "-xvext (-xv)" 
	  switches (and possibly the -yuv switch).  (Alastair Robinson)
	- An X11 build can now grab the keyboard to bypass window managers.  
	  Use "-grabkeyboard (-gkb)" to activate and/or the ALT + PGUP keypress 
	  to toggle it on/off.  (Gerd Sussner)
	- The code for finding the best X11 visual now checks in descending 
	  order of bit depth.  This is to work around a bug/feature in the 
	  latest NVidia drivers.  (Gerd Sussner)
	- Fixed a problem in the DGA2 driver that could lead to scrambled 
	  colors with an i830MG video card in 24bpp mode.  (Eric Brunet, 
	  Shyouzou Sugitani)
	- The SDL target's "-listmodes" switch now operates before attempting 
	  to load a game.  (Shadow Walker)
	- If xmame is iconified in IRIX, it will automatically pause ("boss 
	  hanging around mode").  (Andrea Suatoni)
	- Added a switch to force yv12 mode in the Xv driver; made improvements
	  to the yv12 code.  (Eric Brunet)
	- Xmame should now build "out of the box" for FreeBSD.  Note that for 
	  the SDL target, you may have to set the SDL_CONFIG flag in the 
	  makefile.  (Stijn Hoop)

	  with IRIX, but still doesn't work as it should.  (Andrea Suatoni)

Release 0.58.3 (xmame only), 17 March 2002
	- Cleaned up src/unix/effect.c a bit.  It should now be able to compile 
	  better with non-GCC compilers.  (Inspiration by Marcus Herbert.)

	  (Sven Goethel)
	- Pausing while in fullscreen DGA mode no longer causes the sound to be 
	  lost.  (Steve Slaven)
	- The short version of "-loadconfig" is now "-lcf", since "-lc" was 
	  conflicting with -listcpu.

	- Changed contrib/porting/prep-new-mame to reflect the new .txt files
	  bundled with MAME.

	  xmame-specific directories have been moved into src/unix.  Releases
	  will now have symlinks to these directories in the root.
	- Updated the docs to reflect the new mailing list address, courtesy of
	  Pete French.
	- Fixed an unmatched parenthesis error in src/drawgfx.c that was
	  affecting non-Intel platforms.
	- Fixed a bug in mess/cpu/apexc/apexcdsm.c that was causing xmess
	  linking to fail.
	- Updates to the QNX target: Added sound support via an ALSA hack, added

	- Added support for the RGB 555 mode for targets which support 16bpp
	  displays.
	- Added support for the RGB 888 mode to the x11_window, DGA, and SDL
	  targets.  (Shyouzou Sugitani, Lawrence Gold)
	- Added -sdlmapkey/-sdlmk to the SDL target to allow the remapping of
	  keys.  This should help users with non-U.S. keyboards.
	- Revised the example key remappings in doc/xmamerc.dist and
	  src/unix/xmamerc-keybinding-notes.txt to match the current keycodes.
	  Also added SDL examples.
	- Added the beginnings of QNX 6/QNX 4 support.  The X11 display driver

Release 0.37b11.2
	- MESS 0.37b11 is now included.
	- Full DGA 2.0 support, with automatic depth-switching.  A build on an
	  XFree86 4.0.x system will automatically use the DGA 2.0 calls; if the
	  binary with 2.0 support is run on an XFree86 3.3.x system, it will
	  fall back on DGA 1.0 calls.  (Shyouzou Sugitani, Stea Greene, Matt
	  Lowry)
	- Support for either NetBSD or OSS sound under OpenBSD.  The default is
	  the NetBSD sound interface, which reportedly works better.  (Claudio
	  Castiglia)
	- Cleaner install mechanism in the makefiles; included install-sh script
	  from X11R5 for platforms which lack the install command; the default
	  install prefix is now "/usr/local".  (Claudio Castiglia) 
	- SDL mouse support has been added.  (riq)
	- SDL target should now have all previously missing update routines.
	  (riq)
	- Added "-joydevname (-jdev)" option to select the device prefix for 
	  the i386 joystick.  Defaults to "/dev/js" for Linux and "/dev/joy" 
	  for *BSD.  (Thanks to Laurent Simon for the suggestion.)

Release 0.37b11.1 (xmame only)
	- Everything from MAME 0.37b11.
	- Merged in changes from the src/unix tree that were in the MESS CVS;
	  one of which is that if MAME_DEBUG is enabled, the binary will be
	  called xmamed.<target> or xmessd.<target>.  (Christopher Stone)
	- Commented out the call to osd_dirty_merge() in SDL.c.  The SDL target
	  has its own dirty handling.  (Hans de Goede)
	- The menu colors no longer fade when you pause a game.  (Sean Young)
	- xmess compiles again without having to uncomment VLM5030 in
	  src/mess.mak. (Christopher Stone, Lawrence Gold)

	- Possible fix for a problem with the DGA target on ATI Rage Mobility
	  which caused a switch to fullscreen mode to not change the resolution.
	  (Lawrence Gold)
	- "-listgamelist" no longer prints the column headers (they are shown 
	  by "-listgamelistheader").  (Lawrence Gold)

Release 0.37b10.1
	- Everything from mame 0.37b10 and mess 0.37b10
	- ALSA sound driver uses stream mode; this fixes the problem of
	  continuous static during games.  (Shyouzou Sugitani)
	- Running with DGA 2.0 no longer causes a blank screen with Matrox
	  G200/G400.  (Shyouzou Sugitani)
	- The asm 68k code compiles again.  (Agawa Koji)
	- Building on older gcc, non-gcc, and FreeBSD 3.3 systems works much
	  better.  (Pete French, Olivier Galiber)
	- New unified OpenStep 4.2 Intel/Mac OS X PowerPC code.  (Pete French)
	- The SDL driver now has video_update for 16bpp_to_16bpp; SDL_HWPALETTE
	  was added to the flags of SDL_SetVideoMode (Ricardo Quesada)
	- New version of the mame_perl ROM manager.  (Stefan Becker)
	- Fixes for getcwd/getwd for BSD43 systems.  (Pete French)
	- Running with "-listsamples" no longer causes a core dump.  (me)
	- Sprite corruption fix for the NES driver.  (Christopher Stone, Sean
	  Young, Brad Oliver)
	- The SDL driver now supports 32bpp XFree86 modes.  (Dan Scholnik)
	- The SDL driver now has fullscreen support.  (Patrice Mandin)
	- The back-quote/tilde key now toggles the on-screen display when using
	  the SDL driver.  (me)
	- Gave credit to Tadeusz Szczyrba for writing the original SDL driver.
	- Added a needed call to fflush() in the error logging.  (Christopher
	  Stone).
	- The frontend code ("-list" options) should more or less resemble its
	  MS-DOS counterpart.  Thanks to Christopher Stone for pointing out the
	  problem areas.
	- Added an "openbsd" ARCH define.  (Claudio Castiglia)
	- Fixed some core files to allow building under Solaris 8 using its 
	  native cc.  (Vincent ^_^)
	- Changed the optimization flags in the Makefile for the IRIX platform
	  so that the comment about turning on all optimization holds true.
	  (Chris McCraw)
	- The svgafx target should run again; a call to osd_dirty_merge() had to
	  be commented out.  (henri)
	- Updated the docs to mention problems using Red Hat 7's latest gcc;
	  added suggestion for using ALSA with OSS emulation if OSS problems are
	  experienced.
	- Added a top-level README; removed old-changes.mess, which was
	  identical to messold.txt; extended copyright notice to 2001 and 
	  listed Lawrence Gold as maintainer in config.c.  (Matt Lowry)

Release 0.37b7.1
	- Everything from mame 0.37b7, no mess yet
	- Added support for USB joysticks under FreeBSD thanks to:
	  Christian Weisgerber <naddy@unix-ag.uni-kl.de>
	- Fixed xmame hanging with the message:
	  WARNING: the game might not run correctly.
	  Press any key to continue
	- Made the debugger always use the aspect ratio of the actual monitor,
	  instead of the aspect ratio of the emulated game.

Release 0.37b6.1
	- Everything from mame 0.37b6 & mess 0.37b5 & 0.37b6
	- Alsa sound driver, thanks to: Luc Saillard <luc@alcove.fr>
	  also please send any questions in his direction since I don't
	  have alsa and thus can't test this.
	- Applied a small fix to src/cpu/adsp2100/adsp2100.c, which
	  should fix mk3 and friends, thanks to: Frank Cox
	- Fixed a core bug causing ataxx and brutforc to crash.
	- Some crc and cheatfile changes for xmess by Christopher Stone
	  * The crcdir now defaults to XMAMEROOT/crc
	  * Added a new cheatdir (option -cheatdir) defaulting to
	    XMAMEROOT/cheat
	  * Default cheatfile for MESS is now cheat.cdb
	    (this filename actually gets changed in the core now to
	     gamename.cdb, if the user wants to use her own filename,
	     she can just use anything except cheat.cdb or cheat.dat
	     and it will not be renamed in the core)
	  * xmess now looks for cheat files in cheatdir/filename
	- NETbsd USB joystick driver, thanks to: Krister Walfridsson
	- IA64 support, YEAH, thanks to: Christian Groessler <cpg@aladdin.de>
	- Made XF86-DGA honer -disablemode
	- SGML(linuxdoc) based documentation many many thanks to
	  Rene Herrmann <Rene.Herrmann@gmx.de>
	  The .lyx file is the master file I use, so please submit either
	  patches against the .lyx file, or just plain text additions.
	  Patches against the .sgml file are of no use to me.
	- Added a doc target to the makefile which generates the docs
	  from the sgml source and generates gamelist.xxx, xxxxxxrc.dist and

	- Fixed crashes in 8 bit X-windows with games which resize the screen,
	  like mkla4.
	- Fixed crash on exit in svgaXX displaymethods, when using the mouse
	  and running games which resize the display, like mkla4.
	- Support for the new "graphical" mame debugger. This uses just one
	  window resizing it to the debugger or normal size, using seperate
	  windows for each is something xmame's current architecture is
	  not designed for. This might still happen in the future but not
	  before a rewrite of the video subsystem.
	- Added -debug-size / -ds XXXxYYY, with this you can specify the
	  width and height of the debug window, please keep in mind that
	  the minimum size is 640x480.
	- You can now change the scale of a window on the fly with
	  leftshift +:

	  Page Up	Increase scale
	  Page Down	Decrease scale

	- The asm m68000 core is currently broken, so don't use it! ,
	  on the brighter side of things, neogeo games seems to
	  be working with the C-core now.
	- Fixed the segfault when exiting the xgl version.
	
Release 0.37b4.1
	- Everything from mame & mess 0.37b3 & 0.37b4
	- Note neogeo games don't seem to work this release with the C 68000
	  cpu core, use the asm one instead.

	- Changed the makefile to use the new dos makefiles:
	  -No more makefile editing for each release
	  -No you can build tinymame / neomame / neofree mame too.

	  Stefan Becker <Stefan.Becker@nokia.com>
	- Added tools target to the makefile, to build the platform indepent
	  tools.
	- Added gamelist target to the makefile to generate gamelist.<target>
	- Added SYSDEP_DSP_O_NONBLOCK switch to the sysdep_dsp_create flags,
	  currently only implemented for esound and OSS. And not guaranteed to
	  actually work.
	- Made sound_stream.c check the return value of sysdep_dsp_write,
	  incase it doesn't succeed / doesn't write all data. This should
	  fix xmame with alsa's OSS emulation.
	- Added Dingus Family <ddingus@usewest.net> as irix maintainer to
	  readme.unix
	- Added Jacob A. Hart <c9710216@studentmail.newcastle.edu.au> as
	  freebsd maintainer to readme.unix

	  Christopher Stone <tkmame@retrogames.com>
	- Changed the config file parsing order a bit, now also parses global
	  per game config files, see -help output, thanks to:
	  Christopher Stone <tkmame@retrogames.com>
	- Added prelimenary sgml-ised version of xmame-docs, see doc/html.
	  Many thanks to: Rene Herrmann
	- Xmame should no longer crash when compiled with DGA and run as root
	  on a remote display. (Work around for an XFree86 bug)
	- Xmames frontend code now checks for games which don't use any roms,
	  yet still have a ROM_REGION defined. Like the "genesis" driver under
	  xmess.

Release 0.37b2.2
	- 0.37b2.1 featured a rewrite of the keyboard handling to add unicode
	  support, unfortunatly I only adopted the x11 based drivers, and
	  forgot the others, so only the x11 based ones compiled. This release
	  has much cleaned up and rewritten keyboard support for:
	  -svgalib
	  -ggi
	  -xgl
	  -xfx
	  -svgafx
	- Made the unicode support for X11 actually work (shift and altgr are
	  now honered)
	- Corrected a small type in makefile.obj-xmess, thanks to:
	  Peter Trauner
	- Fixed the creation of tape images in xmess, thanks to:
	  Oscar Martín González
	- Updated the romalizer script in contrib to v0.6, thanks to:
	  tkmame@larry.ztnet.com

Release 0.37b2.1
	- Everything from mame & mess 0.37b2.
	- Fixed brightness handling on pause, the brightness no longer
	  gets darker and darker if you pause/unpause a lot.

Release 0.37b1.2
	- (Re)added mess 0.37b1, including everything that's new.
	- The solaris sound drivers now uses AUDIODEV if set thanks to:
	  Keith Hargrove.
	- Made sound update synchronious with video update,
	  this should improve sound quality.
	- Fixed a crash when running with -nosound -fakesound.
	- Added detection of buggy FreeBSD newpcm driver, and fallback
	  to timerbased audio when detected.
	- Slightly changed the fragsize calculation in the oss dsp plugin,
	  again, it now uses slightly smaller frags, which should increase
	  sound quality a bit.
	- Changed the default soundbufsize to 3.0, this is still smaller as
	  before the default bufsize before the sound rewrite, and it seems
	  that the 2.0 was a bit to optimistic.

Release 0.37b1.1
	- Everything from mame 0.37b1, no mess yet, if you want mess
	  use 0.36.1 .

Release 0.36.1
	- Everything from mame & mess 0.36rc2 & 0.36 final.
	- Fixed a compile error in the solaris dsp-plugin.
	- Removed cheat,doc, cheat.dat and history.dat as they were out of
	  date, get the most rescent version from http://www.mame.net.
	- Slightly changed the fragsize calculation in the oss dsp plugin,
	  it now takes the samplerate used into account.
	- Added -verifyromsets and -verifysamplesets, both are less verbose,
	  more easy parsable versions of -verifyroms resp -verifysamples.
	- Added a number of hints about compiling for optimal performance
	  to readme.unix, thanks to: Frank Cox <theatre@spreda.sk.ca>
	- The i386 joystickdriver now also supports freebsd, thanks to:
	  Robert Muir <rmuir@looksharp.net>
	- Fixed (rewrote) the console switch handling for svgalib / svgafx,
	  it now works with version 1.4.1 and higher compiled without
	  background support (such as distributed with RedHat 6.2).
	- Improved ggi mode selection, added -xres, -yres to force a
	  certain mode, thanks to Christian Groessler.
	- Openstep support has been updated for the new palette code, so
	  the openstep version should compile again. Still no sound
	  though, thanks to: Bat.
	- Changing the volume under Solaris should no longer cause the
	  sound to stop working, thanks to Mathis Rosenhauer.
	- Solaris sound has been reported to work for SunOS too.

Release 0.36rc1.1
	- Everything from mame & mess msdos 0.36rc1
	- Cleaned up the -list options output and made it more consistent,
	  this could cause some slight problems with frontends, but
	  the changes aren't that big. This should be the last time the
	  format changes (I hope).
	- Changed -bufsize to be in frames, so that it automagicly scales
	  for games which have more / less frames / sec. The default of 2
	  should be fine for everyone, please lett me know if you need to
	  change this option, if no-one needs it it will be removed in a
	  future release.
	- Added a sound buffering layer on top of the new core sound mixer
	  code. This is nescesarry, since the new buffering code only allows
	  very slightly variating the number of samples per frame, and with
	  OSS for example the number of samples per frame could variate a
	  lott.
	- Fixed OSS sound plugin compilation under freebsd.

Release 0.36b16.1
	- Everything from mame & mess msdos 0.36b16
	- Fixed error messages for: "error optionx requires an argument".
	- Fixed --boolean option parsing.
	- Fixed bools in configfiles overriding commandline.
	- Fixed printing of NULL strings in -showconfig.
	- Fixed -vectorres for vertical oriented games.
	- Reworked and cleaned up the makefile, you can now choose your os
	  and cpu seperatly. This adds linux-sparc support amongst other
	  things.
	- Made oss.c compatible with linux/powerpc giving sound on this
	  platform thanks to John Cramp.
	- Wrote a generic plugin system, currently only supporting static
	  plugins, but prepared for dynamic plugins.
	- Rewrote the entire sound subsystem, to match a few core changes.
	  Sound-drivers are now plugins, allowing for example esd support.
	  All sound drivers need to be converted to this new system.
	  Platforms which sound-driver(s) haven't been converted, don't
	  have sound.
	- Added a sound-mixer (for volume control) subsystem, again plugin
	  based.
	- Converted the oss driver to be a dsp plugin.
	- Added an oss mixer plugin.
	- Updated (fixed) SDL display driver, thanks to: Ricardo Calixto
	  Quesada (riq@ciudad.com.ar).
	- Added an esound dsp plugin.
	- Fuzzy name matching alla the dos port, thanks to: Andrea Vettorello
	  <molotov@dei.unipd.it>.
	- Don't parse the game specific rc file untill the final name lookup
	  has been done (for fuzzy / random name matching).
	- Converted the netbsd sounddriver to be a dsp plugin, thanks to:
	  Krister Walfridsson <cato@df.lth.se>
	- Removed emulation of analogjoysticks using the mouse, this is now
	  done by the core.
	- Converted the solaris sounddriver to be a dsp plugin, added
	  a mixer plugin thanks to: Mathis Rosenhauer

Release 0.36b15.2
	- Fixed the X11 target when compiled with XIL but without
	  MITSHM.
	- Fixed compiling on machines without DGA (sorry about this one ;)
	- Added -version / -V to show the version, mainly for frontends.
	- Fixed -listclones.
	- Now accepts both -option and --option (--version for example)
	- -showconfig no longer tries to print string options which are
	  NULL.
	- Updated german readme, thanks to: Robert Hamberger
	- Renamed signal to sound_signal in src/sndhrdw/geebee.c, this
	  should fix compiling it under HP-UX

Release 0.36b15.1
	- Everything from mame & mess msdos 0.36b15
	- Removed the IRIX specific c-compiler entry in the makefile
	  as this doesn't work on all machines, and shouldn't be needed
	  on most others. Added hint about adding -DHAVE_SNPRINTF to
	  CFLAGS for IRIX 6.5 .
	- Changed all occurences of xmame.retrogames.com to x.mame.net .
	- Completed contrib dir documentation.
	- Added nvram file support.
	- Fixed -gamma-correction and -brightness.
	- Fixed (worked around) xgl crash with nvidea xgl drivers.
	- Rewrote the config file susbsytem. It's much more modular now and
	  can be used for other projects.
	- Did the rename and move blues to get all the options in the
	  modules where they belong. Removed a lott of global symbols.
	- Xmame/xmess now parses all configfiles found starting
	  with the most global files, and ending with the gamespecific file.
	  The later parsed files can overwrite options in the previous
	  parsed files.
	- Each videomethod compile now only supports it's own options. In order
	  to get rid of the warnings xmame now also parses a videomethod
	  specific file, where you can put the videomethod specific config
	  parameters. Taking the x11 video method as an example the extra
	  parsed files are:
	  $XMAMEROOT/xmame-x11rc and
	  $HOME/.xmame/xmame-x11rc for 
	  See doc/readme.unix for more info.
	- Added mame_perl-1.0 to contrib/tools. Yet Another Romsets Manager
	  by: Stefan Becker

Release 0.36b14.1
	- Everything from mame-msdos 0.36b14 & mess-msdos 0.36b14.
	- Fixed make install for xmess
	- Fixed -ident crash
	- Fixed a small xmess link error
	- Sorta fixed galaxian & clones (they run now)
	- Updated the email adress for the openstep maintainer
	- Added a suggested set of german keymappings to doc/xmamerc.dist,
	  thanks to: Peter Trauner
	- Implemented crc checking for xmess, added -crcdir option.
	- Added crc database files from the mess dos distribution.
	- Readded the 16bpp speedup using int copies for DGA, since it is now
	  in the generic palette system, it is now also used for regular X and
	  GGI.
	- Xmame now detects if 16bpp is not available and falls back to 8bpp
	  automagicly.
	- Added color approximation in X11-window 8bpp mode, this means
	  that -privatecmap isn't needed anymore to get a non-black emulation,
	  -privatecmap is still faster though.
	- Made the mouse buttons seperate buttons instead of piggy backed upon
	  the joystick buttons, as the latest dos releases.
	- Fixed a header conflict with the xgl target

Release 0.36b13.1
	- Everything from mame-msdos 0.36b12 & mess-msdos 0.36b12 &
	  mame-msdos 0.36b13 & mess-msdos 0.36b13.
	- New palette subsystem for the new 16 bpp paletised modes,
	  making life easier for the display drivers, still room
	  for improvement but a good start.
	- Updated german readme thanks to: Robert Hamberger
	- HP-UX compilation fixes, thanks to: Stefan Becker
	- Netbsd 8 bit sound fix, thanks to: Krister Walfridsson

Release 0.36b11.1
	- Everything from mame-msdos 0.36b9 & mess-msdos 0.36b9 &
	  mame-msdos 0.36b10 & mess-msdos 0.36b10 &
	  mame-msdos 0.36b11 & mess-msdos 0.36b11.
	- These changes include a changed output for -verifyroms which could
	  break some frontends
	- These changes also include some palette changes: -[no]16bitvideo
	  has been removed and replaced by -bpp xxx (auto,8 or 16).
	  If your display can only handle 8 bpp you should specify -bpp 8.
	  Otherwise the default of auto will do fine.
	- Fixed the x86-asm m68000 cpu core compile problems.
	- Fixed problems with mess emulations which use r/w disk images,
	  note that these don't support gzipped or zipped images.
	- Fixed possible bufferoveruns with very long rompaths in
	  fileio.c. This was never a security risk since xmame drops root
	  rights before doing any fileio.
        - This also changed the behaviour of -rompath it now longer adds a 
          path to the rompath but instead replaces the entire rompath.
	- Added a portable standalone snprintf implementation from mutt,
	  for those platforms which don't have snprintf. Add
	  -DHAVE_SNPRINTF -DHAVE_VSNPRINTF to DEFS.arch if your platform
	  has these functions to use your libc implementation and not the
	  one shipped with xmame, and please lett me know. This has already
	  been done for: linux-* netbsd-* freebsd
	- Fixed problems with -verifyroms failing on zippedroms with
	  the wrong names but right checksums, while playing the game works
	  fine.
	- Added virtual root support to the -run-in-root-window option,
	  now xmame can be used as a part of xscreensaver ;)
	- Wrote a little script to run a random game in the root window for 2
	  minutes and then run another random game etc. Use this as the extern
	  command for xscreensaver, it is in contrib/tools/xmame-screensaver .
	  Usage:
	    - compile the x11 version of xmame
	    - install it somewhere in your path
	    - copy xmame-screensaver to /usr/games
	    - edit ~/.xscreensaver , and add a line:
	      /usr/games/xmame-screensaver
	- Really fixed the glide compile problems <sigh>.
	- Alpha sound fixes, thanks to Christian Groessler.
	- Rearranged the contrib directory, now everything is devided into
	  a few subdirs: frontends, patches, porting and tools.
        - Added / updated a few readme's in the contrib dir (not complete yet).
	- Fixed timerbased audio in combination with xf86-DGA.
	- Fixed netbsd joystick support to use the correct device names.
	- Fixed up the artwork searching method to be a bit more logical,
	  see readme.unix for a description .

Release 0.36b8.1
	- Everything from mame-msdos 0.36b7 & mess-msdos 0.36b7 &
	  mame-msdos 0.36b8 & mess-msdos 0.36b8
	- Merged in the new 0.36b7 mess release. You can now specify if
	  you want to build mess or mame at the top of the makefile.
	  Xmess and xmame are built in a seperate obj dir so you can safely
	  build both in the same tree, even at the same time if you want to.
	- Renamed lotts of doc files for the mess merge, see the doc dir.
	- Replaced all occurances of j.w.r.degoede@et.tudelft.nl with
	  hans@highrise.nl which is my new email the old one will disappear
	  soon. Also fixed any url's still referring to the old homepage.
	- Replaced #include <glide.h> by #include <glide/glide.h>. So you
	  nolonger have to specify /usr/include/glide as additional include
	  path.
	- Fixed xmame setting the root cursor to invisible when switching to
	  fullscreen with the mouse grabbed.
	- Fixed xmame forgetting that it had the mouse grabbed when to focus
	  was switched away with the keyboard under enlightenment.
	- You can't grab the mouse anymore when you specify -nomouse.
	- Changes the svgalib tweaked mode code a bit, the 240x272 mode has
	  been removed since it was broken. Added some more tweaked modes
	  from the dos team including some planar tweaked modes:
	  384x256
          384x240
          384x224
          336x240
          256x240
          256x256 vertical orientation
          240x256
          Note if you use -noplanar you won't get the tweaked planar modes
          either.
        - Added -centerx <#> -centery <#> with these you can change
          the center of all tweaked modes.
        - Added scanline support to 320x240
	- Svgalib version now restores textmode when mame exits with:
	  Error: gfx[0] extends past allocated memory
	- Changed -list output to seperate the different games with spaces
	- Added romalizer 0.53 to the contrib dir this is a tcl script
	  for cleaning up your rom collection by: Christopher Stone
	  For more info see tkmame.retrogames.com.
	- The asm68000 core is know to cause problems, and the speed gain is
	  not impressive. Documented this.
	- Sunos is now on the supported list, thanks to
	  Saga <jolletx@cybercable.fr>
	- Rethinked the way the rompath was handled, if you want the old
	  behaviour and your rompath was:
	  rompath /foo:/bar
	  change it into:
	  rompath /foo/roms:/foo/samples:/foo/artwork:/bar/roms:/bar/samples:/bar/artwork
	  For an exact description of the new rompath handling for both
	  xmame and xmess see readme.unix.
 	- Experimental sample synchronysing code in src/unix/sound.c
	  should decrease the incident of dropped/skipped samples.
	  This is disabled by default you can enable it with -samplesynch,
	  see readme.unix for more info.
	  Please give it a spin and mail your experiences to the xmame-list.
	  Thanks to William A. Barath.
	- Updated barath frameskip code with load detection.
	  Thanks to William A. Barath.
	- Added a alsa-sound driver to the contrib dir as alsa.c copy it
	  over src/unix/sound-drivers/oss.c and add -lasound to EXTRA_LIBS
	  in makefile.unix. Thanks to "Who Wants to Know?"
	- You can now run xmame / xmess in your root-window as screen-saver
	  / background. This can be enabled with -run-in-root-window.
	- Added random game support option, specify random as game to
	  play a random game ;)
	- New openstep video code supporting scaling and 16bpp video modes
	  Thanks to Bat
	- New openstep makefile entries now with support for:
	  - OpenStep for Intel
	  - OpenStep for Motorola
	  - OpenStep for Sparc
	  - Mac OS X for Intel
	  - Mac OS X for PPC
	  Thanks to Bat
	- Completly rewritten ggi video code with:
	  - scaling
	  - 16bpp support
	  - works on 8, 16, 24 and 32 bpp X servers
	  Thanks to Christian <cpg@aladdin.de>

Release 0.36b6.1
	- Everything from msdos 0.36b4 & b5 & b6
	- Lotts and lotts of thanks goto William A. Barath for
	  sorta taking my place while I was busy switching jobs and for a
	  lotts of the improvements in this release.
	- After a lott of discussion on the mailinglist about which
	  frameskipping method is the best, selectable frameskipping methods
	  have been added. Use -frameskipper # or the frameskipper keyword
	  in xmamerc to configure this. The frameskipmethod can also be
	  changed runtime with left-control + key combinations.
	  Currently available frameskippers are:
	  0   lctrl+insert   Dos frameskipping code
	  1   lctrl+home     Improved frameskipping code thanks to  William A.
	                     Barath
        - added toggleable idle sleeping "-[no]sleepidle" which can make
	  xmame run smoothly on a loaded machine as well as freeing the
	  CPU so we can do more than just play games... :) This defaults
	  to -nosleepidle. You can see that it is enabled by an 'S' in the
	  fps display. There also a T there if throttle is enabled. This can
	  be toggled runtime with shift + F10. Thanks to William A. Barath.
	- added upper-bound for autoframeskip "-maxautoframeskip <#>" which
	  assures a playable framerate even if the emulation can't keep up
	  with real time. Thanks to William A. Barath.
	- Made -geometry work for fx and gl versions, it can be used to
	  specify the windowsize / resolution now. Thanks to Nguyen The Toan
	- Fixed XIL (again) Thanks to Taso N. Devetzis
	- Fixed screenshots for 16bpp games. Thanks to Mathis Rosenhauer for
	  the hint where the problem was.
	- It turn out that xmame compilation breaks when using egcs-1.1.x or
	  gcc-2.95, added note to use -fno-strict-aliasing to fix it.
	  gcc-2.95.1 does work with -fstrict-aliasing, and gives a nice
	  speed increase.
	- Quieted make output. Thanks to David R. Hampton
	- Fixed making of obj/cpu/m68000/m68kops.o to not use implicit rules
	  this was needed for the quieting to work. This should also
	  make our openstep users very happy.
	- Preliminary SDL display target. Thanks to: Tadeusz Szczyrba
	- Fixed the trailing problem in a lott of dirty using games thanks
	  to William A. Barath for pointing me in the right direction.
	- This also fixes the > 7 frameskip values to not skip more frames
	  then asked.

Release 0.36b3.1
	- Everything from msdos 0.36b3
	- Fixed a bug in the new svgalib code which caused modes which are
	  non tweaked, non planar and nonlinear to stay black / crash.
	  This should also fix the problems people where having with vector
	  games.
	- Fixed svgafx compilation, Thanks to: "Chris, Lo Cheuk Kong"
	- Fixed svgafx running suid root
	- Added console switching to svgafx
	- Removed -fxgamma this was not possible with a clean solution to
	  suid root 3dfx support.
	- Fixed 16bpp modes on cards which use 65536 colors instead of 32678
	  with svgalib, thanks to: William Barath
	- Workaround for a DGA bug on Matrox G100 cards which causes the
	  display to be corrupted. Thanks to: d.swanson
	- Made -listroms respect -stdout-file by: Chris from TKMAME
	- Fixed xgl compilation.
	- I couldn't find a clean and portable way to tell Mesa to init glide
	  without switching to 3d mode, which is needed since glide needs to
	  be initialised before any commandline parsing is done for security
	  reasons. Thus setuid root support for Mesa on glide is broken.
	  Use /dev/3dfx instead. Any help appreciated.
	- Added autoconf to the cutdown zlib instead of the generic unix
	  makefile.
	- Added the original copyright notice to the cutdown zlib (oops)
	- Removed the .o en .a files from contrib-zlib as distributed,
	  added removing them to make clean (oops 2)

Release 0.36b2.1
	- Everything from msdos 0.36b2.
	- Fixed tweaked mode restoration after console switch with svgalib
	  for the soon to be releases svgalib 1.4.1 thanks to: Matan Ziv-Av
	- Fixed the pause(BREAK) key. It should have worked from the start,
	  I don't know how this bug slipped in.
	- Fixed the cheat menu.
	- Added auto doubling of width- or heightscale for 1:2 pixel aspect
	  games (like goldstar). Use -noautodouble to disable.
	- Added optimsed scaling code for 1x2x scaling for 1:2 pixel aspect
	  games (like goldstar)
	- Added new mode selection code for svgalib and DGA which not only
	  tries to fill the entire screen but also tries to keep the aspect
	  ratio correct. Use -nokeepaspect to get the old behaviour
	  of trying to fill as much screen as possible.
	  Thanks to: William Barath
	- Implemented 16bpp modes for X11 in a window, DGA and svgalib. Xmame
	  uses these modes when available and nescesarry. use -no16bitvideo to
	  disable them.
        - Enhanced -disablemode now it is either of:
          -disablemode XresxYres
          -disablemode XresxYresxDepth
          Use it with xDepth to disable a mode just for a certain colordepth
          Accepted depths are: 256, 65536.
	- Implemented scaling other then 1x1 and 2x2 for 24bpp packed pixel
	  modes.
	- Rewrote joystick handling code to match the new core handling code
	  Xmame now supports upto 8 joysticks with upto 16 axis / stick and 
          upto 16 buttons / stick. Adding more sticks/axis/buttons is just a
	  matter of changing a few #define's now. Since xmame now supports 
          more then 2 axis -[no]swapjoyaxis has been removed.
	- Fixed saving of more then 1 snapshot.
	- Fixed -widthscale 2 -heightscale 1 for DGA and svgalib
	- Added contrib/modelines. This is a file with a bunch of tweaked mode
	  modelines for XFree86. Kindly contributed by William Barath
	- Xmame now saves cfg, sta and mem files in seperate dirs in
	  $(HOME)/.xmame So if you want to keep your old ones move them.
	  Files:	Go in / become:
	  XXX.cfg	$(HOME)/.xmame/cfg/XXX.cfg
	  XXX.mem	$(HOME)/.xmame/mem/XXX.mem
	  XXX.sta	$(HOME)/.xmame/sta/XXX.sta
	  And xmame now searches for game specific rc files as:
	  $(HOME)/.xmame/rc/<gamename>rc
	  Thanks to: TKMAME
	- Added a cutdown version of zlib in contrib which can be used
	  instead of the system wide version (see makefile.unix). For 
	  systems which have no or a broken zlib. Thanks to: Matt Lowry
	- Rewrote svgalib mode selection code (again) now it doesn't use
	  a static list of modes anymore but queries the available modes
	  from svgalib like DGA does under X11. This means that special
	  modes in svgalib replacements like scitech display doctor and
	  ggi can be used.

Release 0.36b1.2
	- Added emulation of arcade cabinet lights through the keyboard leds
	  for svgalib. X doesn't seem to support this, help appreciated.
	- Added -geometry option, to specify the location where
	  the xmame window appears.
	- Added -[no]linear to enable/disable linear framebuffer support with
	  svgalib. It defaults to off since lfb is broken on some cards.
	  This fixes the black screen problem some people where having.
	- Added a keymapping for the ^ key on german keyboards so that the
	  on screen display works under X.
	- Reordered the output for -help so that it makes more sense.
	- Added a few accidently ondocumented options to -help
	- Fixed xgl, xfx, svgafx and openstep compile. Since I don't have
	  openstep and / or an 3dfx over here this is untested.
	- Changed -scale, -widthscale & -heightscale so that they do the
	  logical thing. Meaning that the last one parsed determines
	  the scales used.
	- Added -vectorres <XresxYres>, this scales vectorgames to XresxYres,
	  keeping their aspect ratio. This overrides the scale options.

Release 0.36b1.1
	- Everything from msdos 0.36b1
	- With al the testing of the svgalib code, a bug which has been
          there for ages has been found and fixed. This bug cause a shifted
	  and cropped screen with games which require a resolution >= 640x480
	  and visualsize != size
	- Rewrote the svgalib mode selection code, -videomode was removed.
	  Use -[no]tweak and -[no]scanlines instead
	- Added linear framebuffer support to the svgalib code
	- Added doublebuffer support to svgalib scaled modes
	- Added -disablemode <XRESxYRES> option for svgalib this can be used
	  to disable a specific mode when it gives trouble on your system.
	  So that for example only one troublesome tweaked mode can be disable
	  instead of disabling all tweaked modes.
	- Improved doublebuffer alloc code for XF86DGA, don't malloc the
	  buffer if it isn't used.
	- Improved doublebuffer avtivation code it is now also used for
	  2x2 scanlines mode giving a nice speedup.
	- Removed the unix-only core-patch to align words according to Nicola
	  this shouldn't be nescesarry anymore. If you have trouble running
	  z80 (and probably other) games on non intel machine's. Try applying
	  the patch, it is in contrib/ as word-align-patch
	- Changed the xkeymappings back so that the winkeys (META) are mapped
	  to alt. This was nescesarry to support international keyboards.
	- Added -[no]winkeys to map the winkeys under X (META) to the winkeys
	  under xmame. Use this if you have a winkeyboard and want to use
	  your windows keys under xmame. This option doesn't do anything for
	  non X versions of xmame.
	- Added -screenshotdir <dir> to specify where xmame saves the png
	  screenshots made by pressing F12. It defaults to the current
	  working dir (.) .
	- Added the IRIX buggy compiler fix for MWA_NOP to MRA_NOP too,
	  this should fix a load of games on IRIX. You could ofcourse
	  also use a real compiler, grrr.

Release 0.35.3
	- Really fixed the bug in the svgalib code, now it's also
	  fixed for resolutions >= 640x480, and thus for vector games.

Release 0.35.2
	- Fixed a nasty bug in the svgalib code

Release 0.35.1
	- Everything from msdos rc2, 0.35 release + fixes
	- Some alpha compile and alignment fixes (by Christian Groessler)
	- Added netbsd-alpha as target (by Christian Groessler)
	- Some powerpc compile fixes
	- Windows keys are now recognised and can be used, under X
	  your X needs to be configured properly for this though

Release 0.35rc1.1
	- Everything from msdos b13 & rc1 highlights:
	  - Now all display targets do snapshot in png format
	  - png support needs zlib, since png is in the core zlib is
	    now mandatory
	  - history.dat file location can now be specified
	- Updated German README
	- Many changes to the blit-core these include:
          -use memcpy's to speed up where possible
          -use doublebuffering when doing direct framebuffer access,
           and scaling.
          -simulated scanlines when scaling
          -hand optimised cases for 3x and 4x inproved generic case
          Overall this should give a nice speedup in a lott of cases.
          Much of the work and ideas where contributes by a kind soul whos
          email and name I've lost. If you read this please mail me so you can
          be given proper credit.
        - Don't crash on exit when no suitable DGA mode can be found
	- Made xmame emmit warnings and continue on errors in xmamerc, instead
          of emmit errors and exit (By TKMAME)
	- Made xmame except fxmame and glmame options even when not compiled
          with fx / gl, it just ignores them.
	- Added some boundary checks in: sound/adpcm.c and vidhrdw/megasys1.c
	  this fixes edf in b12. I don't know wether it's still nescesarry in
	  rc1, thus these changes are backed out and are now available in:
	  contrib/boundary-check-patch

Release 0.35b12.1
	- Everything from msdos b11 & b12
	- Changed the way the makefile handles the generated c-files for the
	  m68000 c-core again. Now openstep should be happy too.
	- Changed TRUE -> OSD_OK in a number of sounddrivers this should fix
	  compile problems for: irix, netbsd_i386 and aix.
	- Added a spanish tranlation of the readme by Vicente Aguilar.

Release 0.35b10.2
	- Fixed a bug in the config parsing code which caused core dumps at
	  start on most non x86 platforms.
	- Changed the way the makefile handles the generated c-files for the
	  m68000 c-core. Now it also works with compilers which don't like
	  object files with an unusual suffix (.og instead of .o).

Release 0.35b10.1
	- Everything from msdos b10
	- Updated the debuger code, now it should work again and it looks a
	  lott better as the old code.
	- GGI support updated for ggi2.0b2 and some other small fixes.
	  By Christian Groessler
	- As requested changed the init sequence for x11 so that -list options
	  can be used even without a display. This only works for binaries
	  without DGA support due to security reasons.

Release 0.35b9.1 (Never got released the mame team released b10 before)
	- Everything from msdos b9.
	- Updated solaris sound-driver which also supports solaris i386.
	  Thanks to Mathias for this.
	- Installed solaris x86, Fixed XIL.
	- Also fixed mitshm on solaris.
	- Some fixes to fix-comments to handle nice c-code like: '"' and "\\"

Release 0.35b8.1
	- Everything from msdos b8.
	- Note about history.dat:
	  The new dos-release uses a file called history.dat to display some
	  nice background info on games. Unfortunatly the location of
	  history.dat is hardcoded into the core as just history.dat in the
	  current working directory. Thus if you want to use it you need to
	  start xmame in the dir where history.dat resides or at least create
	  a shell script which cd's into this dir before executing xmame.

Release 0.35b7.1
	- Everything from msdos b7.
	- Added -listinfo option
	- Did the rename and move blues, lotts of restructering of the unix
	  code. End users won't notice this except that it probably has
	  introduced a couple of bugs ;)

Release 0.35b6.1 (Aka naming releases was fun while it lasted)
	- Everything from msdos b6
	- Added 24bpp packed pixel support for X11 by Trent Piepho
	- Added 24bpp packed pixel and 32 bpp support to xf86-dga
	- Removed the z80 fix. Jurgen, from the dos team, has fixed the z80
	  core so that it now works with gcc 2.7.2.x too. Please reports
	  any new problems with z80 games.

Release 0.35b5.1 (Aka yar (yet another release))
	- Everything from msdos b5
	- Fixed a vsb (very stupid bug) which caused xmame
	  to hang on exit sometimes
	- Reintroduced the z80 fix from 0.35b2, you only need it if
	  your using gcc, you can disable the fix in the makefile if your
	  using egcs for a slight performance increase. This only affects
	  x86 users. Also note that since the dos-team now is using gcc 2.8.1
	  more of these bugs might popup, so if you have egcs use it.

Release 0.35b4.2 (Aka the brown paperbag release)
	- Fix a compile bug in src/unix/config.c

Release 0.35b4.1
	- Everything from msdos b3 & b4.
	- contrib/fix-comments.c no longer generate: /*/////*/ but instead:
	  /*///////////// */
	- Nicola from the dos-port honored my request and in one go all
	  ACORN and linux_alpha defines have been changed to ALIGN_INTS,
	  ALIGN_WORDS and LP64, thanks Nicola
	- Before parsing $HOME/.xmame/xmamerc xmame now first looks if
	  $HOME/.xmame/<gamename>rc exists and parses that instead if found.
	  By Chris (from TKmame) 

Release 0.35b2.1
	- Everything from msdos b2.
	- An interesting note from whatsnew.txt,
	  which might be worth repeating:
	  Note: the configuration save format has changed. You may just as well
	  delete all of the cfg/*.cfg files, since they won't be loaded. Old
	  .inp files will not work either. The good news is that the default
	  key assignments can now be modified, so you don't have to change them
	  for all the games. The code is a quick hack put together in fifteen
	  minutes, but it's bettern than nothing. It will be improved
	  in future versions.
	- Worked around the compilation of the z80-core with -DX86_ASM, still
          working on this with Juergen
	- Added 16 bit & stereo sound-support. Many thanks to Mike Oliphant
	  For writing this. Use -mono, -8bit to get the old behaviour back.
	- Added a new blitting macro, now used for svgalib, X en dga.
	  taking away a lott of old almost the same code. This also means that
	  X now uses direct image access even in truecolor modes speeding
	  things up quite a bit. And update_dsp* files were all removed since
 	  since they are now unnescesarry.
	- The above is really all added bonus, the mean reason was to also
	  write a generic scaling system. So now dga and svgalib also support
	  scaling.
	- Removed -forcetrucolor, since it doesn't do anything anymore with
	  the new blitting macro.

Release 0.35b1.1
	- Everything from msdos including autoframeskip use:
	  -autoframeskip / -noautoframeskip to en-/disable.
	  It's enabled by default.
	- Bat wrote snapshot support (F12) for openstep.

Release 0.34.2
	- Fixed a bug which caused:
	  X Error of failed request:  BadValue
	  When running in a window under X11 with a game which doesn't
	  support dirty, and has a visual area which isn't quad-word aligned.

Release 0.34.1 
	- Everything from dos 0.34 final
	- The mouse is now ungrabbed when the window looses focus.
	- Ggi dirty support, tested with ggi 2.0beta1

Release 0.34rc2.1
	- Everything from dos rc 2
	- Added mouse grabbing, press left-alt + page-down to grab the mouse
	  under X, press it again to release it. Use -grabmouse to start
	  with the mouse grabbed.
	- Added invisible mousecursor for people using focus follows mouse,
	  use -nocursor to make the cursor invisible, grabbing the mouse as
	  above also makes it invisible. This was kindly contributed by:
	  Dave Dribin
	- Removed ROMPATH, SPOOLDIR etc defines from makefile.unix and
	  replaced them with XMAMEROOT by Christian Groessler
	- Fully intergrated openstep support, it now no longer needs the files
	  in contrib, see README.unix
	- Added sound synchronisation for streamed sound, this should fix
	  the lag in pacman. This only works when throttle is enabled.
	- Netbsd-i386 audiobuffer querying support by: Tom Spindler

Release 0.34rc1.1
	- Everything from dos rc 1
	- Merged in glmame-0.6 and fxmame-0.5
	- Fixes for ggi to compile with the latest ggi-snapshot
	- Some fixes to -verifyroms to now use -stdout-file
	- Added preliminary openstep support, see contrib/openstep/README
	  Kindly contributed by Bat.

Release 0.34b8.1
	- Everything from dos beta 8
	- DGA now is a compile option for x11, just like mitshm,
	  use -x11-mode (see -help) to choice between normal window and
	  DGA, or use left-alt + home as a hotkey to jump to fullscreen,
	  and left-alt + insert to jump to a window.
	- Rearranged and rewrote most of the joysticks support, upto 4
          joysticks are now supported. And you can compile in more then 1
	  one joytype, and select which one will be used runtime with -joytype.
	- Support for new linux joystick driver interface, use I386JOYSTICK
	  if the new headers are found they are automaticly used.
	  By: Luca Montecchiani
	- Removed -display commandline option as it intervened with DGA,
	  sorry about that, use $(DISPLAY) instead, or write a wrapper script.
	- Added support for mame's internal debugger, see makefile.unix
	  only enable this if you need it! It's slow.
	- Which obj files are build in the unix dir is now display-method
	  dependent.
	- Unixware7 support by: Richard Cohen

Release 0.34b7.1
	- Everything from dos beta 7
	- Completly new dirty code speeding up xf86,x11 and svgalib
	  quite a bit.
	- -analogmouse options to emulate a analogjostick through the mouse
	  very nice for starwars and maybe others.
	- -verifyroms no also tries to load roms by crc matching the actual
	  loading behaviour.

Release 0.34b6.1
	- Everything from dos beta 6
	- Fixed a bug which caused all checksums to be 0 for non-zipped
	  files.
	- Fixed unpause bug.
	- If not shared with the game, the ui colors are no longer
	  influenced by brightness and gamma settings.
	- Made -widthscale, -heightscale and -scale work for vector games
	  on all supported display-methods, using mame's vector engine todo
	  the scaling. Also for vector games values like 1.5 and even 0.5 are
	  now supported.
	- Spend a lott of time on network support, it should now work for
	  all displaytargets. Exiting one participant no also exits
	  the others instead of hanging them. Timeouts implement, if one side
	  is killed/ connection is broken xmame will continue in single player
	  mode. The network code can now be concidered stable, but still only
	  supports keyboard.
	- Merged in fxmame-0.4 and glmame-0.5
	- Vector.o and inptport.o are compiled in display_method dependend
	  dirs now.
	- Solaris XIL support (hardware scaling) by Elias Martenson.
	- Preliminary Digital Unix support by Leandro Dardini
	- Added tkmame frontend to contrib

Release 0.34b5.2
	- Fixed the __extension__ compile bug, I hope
	- Fixed the segfault when compile without joystick-support &
	  joy = 1 in xmamerc
	- Merged in gl-mame code, many thanks to Mike Oliphant for the
	  excellent and easy to merge patch. see doc/README.xgl
	- Merged in net-mame code, many thanks to Eric Totel, for the also
	  excellent and easy to merge patch. see doc/multiplayer-readme.txt
	- Added a volume xmamerc and commandline option.

Release 0.34b5.1
	- Everything from dos-0.34b4&b5, including the profiler, romident
	  asm 68000! and on screen display.
	- Removed /dev/audio (uLaw) support from linux, since it
	  was seriously broken en useless anyway. The audiodevice option
	  is from now on only usefull to use a second soundcard, see
	  doc/xmamerc.dist.
	- Rearranged most of the code in src/unix/fronthlp.c it's a lott nicer
	  now.
	- Rewrote src/unix/config.c it was nescesarry adding new options is so
	  much easier now. This also means that for consistency with the
	  commandline a lot of options in xmamerc have been renamed and/or
	  added, please copy xmamerc.dist over, and change it as needed.
	- Added -fragsize & -numfrags, see -help and doc/README.unix. This 
	  should help people who experience lagged sound. As a side-result of
	  this all soundbuffers are now dynamicly allocated and thus all OSS
	  problems should be gone, please report any remaining problems.
	- Added -stdout-file and -stderr-file to redirect stdout and stderr to
	  a file at a highlevel so svgalib doesn't bug us. Only usefull for
	  frontends, and only influences text printed by the osd part of
	  xmame, so -list and stuff are redirected, -verifyroms only partial,
	  and mame-core errors and messages are not redirected at all.
	- Cleaned up stdout/stderr use:
	  Stdout is used for requested info like -list options, and -help.
	  Stderr is used for status and error messages.
	- Partially rewrote palette-handling no brightness and gamma-
	  correction are supported, see -help, xmamerc and osd.
	- Robert Hamberger kindly donated a german translation of the readme.
	- New irix AL sound support by Tristram Scott, added Tristram as sgi/irix
	  maintainer.
	- linux-powerpc is now offically supported.
	- Added Mathis Rosenhau as sun/solaris maintainer.

Release 0.34b3.1
	- Everything from dos-0.34b3
	- Fixed the compilation problem on some platforms in config.c
	  (missing includes for sys/stat.h and unistd.h)
	- Speeded up palette cycling under xf86_dga with 8bpp
	- Rewrote X mouse handling now mouse works under xf86_dga
	- Added support for 15bpp truecolor visuals
	- Fixed irix_nosound and aix_nosound targets
	- Fixed a bug in osd_fseek which caused sample loading to fail,
	  now samples work as advertised.
	- Fixed a bug in svgalib & ggi palette handling which caused
	  some strange effects with translucent vectors.
	- Updated README.unix to contain who maintains which arch/os
	  combination and which are currently unmaintained,
	  maintainers wanted!
	- Added a section to README.unix on howto work around yet another
	  bug in the irix c-compiler. See the platform specific hints.
	- Added doc/TODO

Release 0.34b2.2
	- Fixed a bug: .cfg files where still saved in ${HOME}/xmame
	  instead of ${HOME}/.xmame.
	- On startup existence of ${HOME}/.xmame is verified and created
	  if nescesarry
	- On startup a check is done to see if compiled- and
	  runtime-endianess match (actually this has been there for
	  a few releases now but I forgot to mention it ;)
	- Some minor updates to README.unix
	- One note: /usr/games/lib/mame has been changed to
	  /usr/games/lib/xmame for concistency. So rename it, or use the old
	  setting in xmamerc.

Release 0.34b2.1
	- Everything from dos-0.34b2.
	- Everything unix from xmess-0.2b4.1:
	  *Fileio no supports gzipped files and a search path, see README.unix
	   Note: This means that you have to change mamedir to rompath
	   in your xmamerc.
	  *Updated README.unix to contain info on both xmess and xmame
	   not only on xmame.
	  *The title and other reference to xmame/xmess and version are now no
	   longer wrapped in ifdef's but instead are taken from defines set by
	   the makefile so to change the version no, or the name only the 
	   makefile has to be changed from now on.
	- Changed ${HOME}/xmame to ${HOME}/.xmame on popular request so
	  move that dir ;)
	- Makefile.objs no is no longer autogenerated due to some changes
	  in the dos makefile. These changes do mean that the number of objs
	  on the commandline at once have been greatly reduced. So those
	  who got a cmdline to long error shoould be happy now.
	- Updated contrib/porting.txt to include the manual creation of
	  makefile.objs. Added contrib/lowercase which is used for this.
	- Changed fix.c to fix-comments.c which is a more accurate name.
	- Removed autogeneration of makefile.objs from make-makefiles.pl
	  renamed it to fix-includes
	- Updated fix-mame to match the name changes of fix and
	  make-makefiles.pl .
	- General clean-up and restructering of README.unix with much thanks
	  to: Joseph E. Miele
	- The x86-asm m6808 core now also works on other i386 unices, thanks
	  to: Christian Groessler

Release 0.34b1.1
	- Everything from dos-0.34b1.
	- Intergrated xf86-dga support.
	- Hardware palette cycling (as promised way too long ago).
	  It's enabled automaticly, you'll receive a notice of this.
	  Under XFree86 it only seems to work on 8-bit displays with
	  a private colormap (-privatecmap).
	- Changed makefile so that you now choose:
	  a) arch
	  b) display method
	  So we no longer have linux-svgalib and linux-x and linux-ggi and
	  linux-xf86-dga. This esp makes sence since ggi and xf86-dga are
	  also supported on other arch's.
	- Added soft-klipping to the soundmixer. Actually done in 0.33.1
	  but I forgot to mention it there.

Release 0.33.3
	- Again fixed the m6808 asm core, this time a work around for
	  gnu-make not liking a long dep chain.

Release 0.33.2
	- Fixed a minor bug which made the compilation of the x86-asm 
	  m6808 cpucore fail.

Release 0.33.1
	- All the changes from dos-0.33(final).
	- Workaround for an of by one bug in newer oss (the linux sound driver)
	  versions. This caused the big delay for this release and hopefully
	  is now solved.
	- Workaround for an obscure irix compiler bug this means irix is
	  now fully supported, but don't use DCC !
	- Added contrib/xnetmame.tgz this contains files for (beta) network
	  play.
	- Added contrib/esound.diff, apply for sound output to the esound
	  deamon, this patch will be included in a newer version.
	- Added contrib/xf86-dga.diff, apply for xfree86 dga support, this
	  patch will be included in a newer version.
	- Updated contrib/mamex to work with newer versions of mame.
	- Added contrib/mamex.new, an enhanced version.

Release 0.33rc1.1
	- All the changes form dos-0.33rc1
	- Automated the porting process a bit, changed contrib/make-makefiles.pl
          not to generate a malloc-lines log. Since this is not nescesarry
	  anymore. Added contrib/fix-mame. See contrib/porting.txt for
          a quick description on how to use these porting tools, to get a new
          dos version ported to unix.
        - Part of these automation changes it that the objs generated by
	  make-makefiles are now used in makefile.unix by including
	  makefile.core.
        - Due to the above changes also all core-filenames have been made
	  lowercase, finally bringing unity.
	- Changed the compiler hints in README.unix not to use DCC,
	  since that was a bad advice which was causing the malloc trouble in
          the first place. We still have irix problems when using -n32
	  which are being looked into. For now use -o32 when compiling.
	- Added support for the m6808 asm cpu core, it has its own flag in the
	  makefile and defaults to off, this is only tested for linux-x86-elf
	  if anyone wants to get it to work on other x86 archs feel free
	  todo so. And please mail me your results. This requires a copy
	  of nasm, a free x86-asembler, in your path. 
	- Added 16 bit sound calls support.

Release 0.33b7.1
	- All the changes form dos-0.33b7, including a new frontend
	  option (-listclones).
	- Fixed the volume after menu setting bug, for real this time
	- Split update_dsp into true- and pseudo-color specific files,
	  with the hope to one day add a 16 bit mode truecolor variant
	- Cleaned up the error handling in the creation of the X display
	- When running xmame on a remote console mit-shm doesn't only fail
	  but it even tells you it failed amasing isn't it?

Release 0.33b6.1
	- All the changes form dos-0.33b6, including some new frontend
	  options (-listgames, -noclones).
	- Cleaned up keyboard-handling a bit.
	- Changed osd_analog_read to match the new syntax.
	- Added -root_window_id [id] cmdline option to create the window
	  within an existing window, to be used with frontend's
	- Added a credits.unix file, if you think you deserve an entry please
	  remind me, I don't remember all contributers.

Release 0.33b5.1
	- Just a port of dos-0.33b5, using the unix tree from
	  0.33b4.1. Nothing new on the unix-end but the main MAME team has
          added a few new goodies to this release.

Release 0.33b4.1
	- Basicly a port 0f 0.31.1 to 0.33b4
	- added 320x240 and 320x400 to svgalib-version
	- some changes to support the new 0.33 layer code

Release 0.31.1
	- A lott has happenend since the last release, before this release
	  there have been a lott of beta's. And I (Hans) have taken over as
	  main coordinator. This release fixes all known bugs to previous 
	  release's. And we've done our best to make this the best release
	  ever. In the switching and the quick beta-period to catch up,
	  changes have got lost however. The Changes file will be updated from
	  here on again.

	  allow interface with loaders
	- fixed bug in sndhrdw/starforc.c that makes sound too slow
	- fixed bug in src/unix/xdep.c that made incorrect graphics and
	  cores in swaped-xy games when X & Y scale differs

Release 0.29.1
	- Original Mame-029 sources ported to UNIX by Hans de Goede
	- Added "-[no]xsync" and "use_xsync" commandline/config option
	  To select between XFlush() or XSync() screen refresh method
	- Added "spooldir makefile/config/commandline configurable option
          to store high scores
	- Now .xmamerc and per-game user configurations parameters are moved
	  and stored into ${HOME}/xmame/ directory
	- New file update_dsp.c to code video update routines
	- Added -devdsp and -devaudio options to allow selection of audio
          device in those systems that has no /dev/audio
	- Added -showconfig cmdline option to display current running parameters
	  in a xmamerc-like style 
	- Now -DUSE_TIMER works on svgalib. Thanks Hans

Release 0.28.2
	- Added Solaris/ix86 support
	- Added Linux/Alpha support
	- Fixed several bugs in 8910intf.c to makes core in init sound
	- Changed Keyboard code to reset key table when entering/leaving
	  XMame window
	- Lots of porting errors solved
	- Solved (again) missalingned int problems in src/common.c:drawgfx()
	  Blames to Intel for trying to correct programmer errors instead a

	- Added -ror, -rol -flipx, -flipy, -cheat commandline options
	- Changed osd_obtain_pen() to use double-indexed color array for
	  cell allocation. This makes pseudocolor mode as slow than truecolor

	  waster strategy )
	- New fix.c code to make port easy. Thanks Hans
	- Added ultrix support

Release 0.27.2
	- Created new directory contrib. Waitting for your works...

SOUND TESTED ON:
	linux (i586/133) sounds acceptable
	Irix  (SGI Indy ) near nice
	Solaris ( Sparc5 SUNW,CS4231 ) poor, but usable
		( Sparc1+ SUNW,am79c30 ) horrible, better dont use
		( Sparc10 SUNW,dbri ) need more work ( too delayed and tickly )
	AIX	( Reported by Chris Sharp <sharp@hursley.ibm.com> )
		
KNOWN BUGS ( ONLY UNIX SPECIFIC INCLUDED ):
	- AUDIO_TIMER_FREQ is machine dependent
	- Cannot correctly control audio channels in Sparc ( doc wrong :-( )
	- Low quality in audio
	- Some games send long sound samples ( like soundtracks ) that overruns 
	  buffers and make core : -( 
	- Some games dump core when exiting. Don't know why...

TODO:
	- Make it runnable in servers that has no support for 8-bit depht
	  Visuals ( Actually warns and exit )
	- Support for kernel in-built n-channel mixer in Irix
	- Joystick support under Irix ( using the analog input port )
	- Rewrite mixer and buffering sound module
